10:T13ff,<p>The Ukrainian Computer Emergency Response Team (<strong><a href="https://cert.gov.ua/">CERT-UA</a></strong>) has issued a critical security alert regarding a newly identified cyber attack campaign orchestrated by the notorious APT28 group, commonly referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fancy_Bear"><strong>Fancy Bear</strong>.</a> This group is widely believed to have ties to Russian military intelligence, specifically the GRU. The warning, designated CERT-UA#11689, was released on October 25, 2024, and highlights an ongoing phishing campaign that poses significant risks to targeted individuals and organizations.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Details of the Phishing Campaign</strong></h2>
<p>According to CERT-UA, the phishing campaign utilizes deceptive emails that contain a database table and a link leading to what appears to be a Google reCAPTCHA verification dialog. This tactic exploits users' familiarity with CAPTCHA systems, which are typically employed to distinguish human users from bots.</p>
<p>The prevalence of CAPTCHA tools has diminished due to advancements in browser extensions and automatic verification systems; however, their appearance can still elicit a sense of trust among users. Unfortunately, this is precisely what APT28 is counting on.</p>
<p>Upon interacting with the CAPTCHA by checking the "I am not a robot" box, users inadvertently trigger a malicious PowerShell command that is copied to their clipboard. This command is designed to execute harmful actions on the victim's system.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Target Audience and Risks</strong></h2>
<p>The primary focus of this cyber attack appears to be local government employees in Ukraine. While this specificity may reduce immediate concern for the general public, it is essential to recognize that similar tactics could be adopted by other malicious actors. The methodology employed by APT28 serves as a blueprint for potential imitators in the cyber threat landscape.</p>
<p>The initiation of this attack begins with clicking a link in the phishing email. This action leads to the appearance of the CAPTCHA dialog, which then requires further user interaction for the attack to be successful. Victims are prompted to execute several steps: opening the command prompt using the Win+R shortcut, pasting the malware payload with Win+V, and finally pressing Enter to execute it. Such a multi-step process relies heavily on user compliance and trust&mdash;qualities that cybercriminals exploit.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Preventive Measures Against Cyber Attacks</strong></h2>

This latest incident involved hackers exploiting unrotated <strong><a href="https://www.zendesk.com/in/">Zendesk </a></strong>&nbsp;API tokens, which allowed unauthorized access to the platform managing user support tickets. Despite prior warnings and multiple breaches earlier in October, the organization failed to secure its systems adequately, leaving sensitive user data vulnerable to exploitation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Series of Attacks</strong></p>
<p>The recent breach is part of a broader wave of cyberattacks that began on October 9, 2024. During this initial incident, hackers executed a dual assault involving a data breach and a Distributed Denial of Service <strong><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/ddos-attack">(DDoS)</a></strong> attack. They took advantage of an exposed GitLab token that had been vulnerable since late 2022, gaining access to the Internet Archive&rsquo;s source code and compromising personal information from approximately 31 million users. This included email addresses and hashed passwords.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, a pro-Palestinian group named <strong><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet-archive-slowly-returns-to-normal-after-ddos-cyberattack/article68755624.ece">SN_BlackMeta </a></strong>&nbsp;launched a DDoS attack that overwhelmed the Archive&rsquo;s servers, temporarily disrupting access to its services. While these two attacks occurred concurrently, they were orchestrated by different groups, complicating the narrative surrounding the breaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Second Breach: Mid-October</strong></p>

Recently, <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Google </a></strong>&nbsp;has reported a surge in sophisticated phishing attacks targeting its Gmail users, leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly convincing scams. With over&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/10/13/new-gmail-security-alert-for-billions-as-7-day-ai-hack-confirmed/"> 2.5 billion users </a></strong>relying on Gmail for their communications, the platform has become a prime target for hackers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The Rise of AI-Driven Phishing Scams</strong></h3>
<p>AI technology has transformed the landscape of cybercrime, enabling hackers to craft scams that are alarmingly realistic. <strong><a href="https://sammitrovic.com/">Sam Mitrovic</a></strong>, a <strong><a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/solutions/">Microsoft solutions</a></strong> consultant, recently shared his harrowing experience with an AI-driven phishing attack that nearly compromised his Gmail account. His ordeal began with a seemingly innocuous notification requesting approval for an account recovery attempt. This tactic is a common phishing method designed to lure users into fake login portals where they unwittingly provide their credentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mitrovic initially ignored the notification but soon received a phone call from someone claiming to be from Google support. The caller's American accent and authoritative tone were designed to instill confidence and urgency. During the conversation, the caller suggested that Mitrovic's account had been accessed by an unauthorized individual for over a week, heightening the sense of alarm.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Mechanics of Deception</strong></h2>
<p>One of the most alarming aspects of this scam is how convincingly it mimics legitimate communication from Google. When Mitrovic searched for the phone number displayed during the call, he found it linked to genuine Google business pages. However, it turned out to be associated with Google Assistant rather than actual support services. This clever ruse is indicative of how scammers exploit legitimate resources to lend credibility to their schemes.</p>
<p>The conversation escalated as the caller asked if Mitrovic had logged in from Germany&mdash;a tactic designed to create fear and prompt hasty actions. It was only when Mitrovic noticed peculiarities in the caller's speech&mdash;such as repeated phrases delivered with unnerving precision&mdash;that he began to suspect he was dealing with an AI-generated voice.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Warnings from Experts</strong></h2>
<p>Mitrovic's experience echoes similar warnings issued by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garrytan">Garry Tan</a></strong>, founder of <strong><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a></strong>, who also encountered an elaborate phishing scam involving a false identity verification scenario. Tan highlighted that Google does not contact users via phone for account recovery, emphasizing that any unsolicited communication should be treated with skepticism.</p>
<p>Experts urge users to remain vigilant and cautious when receiving unexpected requests for personal information or account recovery notifications. Cybercriminals often rely on panic and urgency to bypass critical thinking, making it essential for individuals to take a step back and assess the situation calmly.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Utilizing Legitimate Tools for Fraud</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to AI-generated calls, scammers are increasingly using legitimate tools like Google Forms to enhance their scams' authenticity. By sending emails that appear to originate from Google's servers, fraudsters can trick unsuspecting users into believing they are interacting with official support channels. These tactics lower suspicion and make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information.</p>
<p>For instance, one recent scam involved sending a fake password reset form via Google Forms, complete with instructions that seemed plausible at first glance. Users are advised to scrutinize such requests carefully and verify their authenticity before taking any action.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Google's Response and User Recommendations</strong></h2>
<p>In response to these escalating threats, Google has launched the Global Signal Exchange (GSE), collaborating with organizations like the Global Anti-Scam Alliance and DNS Research Federation. This initiative aims to share intelligence on scams in real-time, improving the ability of organizations to combat fraudulent activities effectively.</p>
<p>Amanda Storey, Google's senior director of trust and safety, stated that GSE would facilitate faster identification and disruption of scams across various platforms. The goal is not only to protect Gmail users but also to create a comprehensive solution that operates efficiently at internet scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>To safeguard against these advanced threats, users are encouraged to:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Verify Sources: Always confirm the legitimacy of unsolicited requests through official channels.</li>
<li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security makes it more difficult for hackers to gain access.</li>
<li>Stay Informed: Regularly check your account activity for any unusual behavior.</li>
<li>Remain Calm: Do not rush into decisions based on fear; take time to assess any suspicious communication thoroughly.</li>
</ul>
<p>As cybercriminals continue evolving their tactics using AI technologies, it is crucial for Gmail users to remain vigilant and informed about potential threats. By understanding how these scams operate and implementing robust security measures, individuals can better protect themselves against sophisticated phishing attacks that seek to compromise their accounts and personal information.</p>19:T131e,<p>As the one-year anniversary of the devastating Hamas attack on Israel approaches, U.S. security agencies have issued a stark warning regarding potential threats of violence. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/">(<strong>DHS</strong>)</a> released a joint statement on Friday, highlighting that the anniversary, coupled with ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, could serve as a catalyst for extremist actions.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Context of the Threat</strong></h2>
<p>The advisory comes in light of calls for violence against Western nations by various foreign terrorist organizations.

Telegram, a messaging and social media platform popular in Eastern Europe and beyond, has also become a haven for extremists and conspiracy theorists in the U.S. due to its lenient approach to content moderation. Now, with Durov facing serious charges, these groups are anxious about the future of their go-to communication platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Platform for Extremists</strong></p>
<p>Telegram has always been an outlier in the U.S. social media landscape. While platforms like <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/?lang=en">Twitter</a></strong> have implemented strict content moderation policies, Telegram's hands-off approach has attracted a wide range of users, including those with extreme views. The app allows for encrypted messages and the creation of channels, similar to Facebook groups, where users can post videos, images, and other content. Telegram's features have made it a popular choice for far-right groups, including white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The surge of far-right users on Telegram began after Donald Trump's loss in the 2020 presidential election. Disillusioned by what they perceived as censorship on mainstream platforms, these groups sought out alternative spaces where they could communicate without fear of being banned. Telegram's reputation as a free speech haven made it an ideal choice. However, the arrest of its founder has now cast a shadow over its future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Charges and Their Implications</strong></p>
<p>Pavel Durov was detained by French police on August 24 after his private jet landed at an airport near Paris. He faces multiple charges, including complicity in the distribution of child pornography, involvement in drug trafficking, and money laundering. If convicted, Durov could spend more than a decade in prison. The charges stem from allegations that Telegram has been used to facilitate illegal activities, raising questions about the platform's role in enabling criminal behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The arrest has sparked panic among far-right groups that rely on Telegram for communication. In a message posted on a Proud Boys-affiliated Telegram channel, users were urged to find alternative means of communication in case Telegram goes offline or changes its policies. "Does your PB chapter have an alternative means of communication? Now would be the time to ensure that you do," read the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Uncertain Future for Telegram</strong></p>
<p>Despite the serious nature of the charges against Durov, some experts believe that Telegram will continue to operate as usual. <strong><a href="https://techagainstterrorism.org/adamhadley">Adam Hadley</a></strong>, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Tech Against Terrorism, notes that Telegram has weathered similar storms in the past. "Telegram almost certainly will stay up," Hadley said, adding that the platform is resilient and has survived government scrutiny before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://joandonovan.org/"><strong>Joan Donovan</strong>,</a> founder of <strong><a href="https://www.publicinterestinter.net/">The Critical Internet Studies Institute</a></strong>, has been monitoring the response from far-right groups on Telegram. According to Donovan, there is a growing sense of fear and paranoia among these users. "In the past few days, we've been tracking fear and paranoia that, now they&rsquo;ve arrested the CEO, they'll give up all the private information, and Telegram itself will be compromised," Donovan explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Who is Pavel Durov?</strong></p>
<p>Pavel Durov is a 39-year-old billionaire who founded Telegram with his brother in 2013. Originally from Russia, Durov grew up in Italy and now holds French citizenship, along with passports from at least two other countries. He is known for his libertarian views and his commitment to privacy and free speech. Durov's lifestyle is as enigmatic as his app, with reports suggesting he resides in Dubai and travels with a small team of core programmers who keep Telegram running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The arrest of Pavel Durov has left Telegram's future hanging in the balance. While the platform's ability to withstand previous challenges offers some hope to its users, the severity of the charges against Durov cannot be ignored. For the far-right groups that have made Telegram their digital home, the uncertainty surrounding the platform is a cause for concern. Whether Telegram will continue to be a refuge for these groups remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the arrest of its founder has shaken the foundations of a platform that many had come to rely on.</p>22:T1b3c,<p>The tech world converged on Las Vegas this August as <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-24/">Black Hat USA 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Defcon/comments/1aj6ixn/def_con_was_canceled_but_we_uncanceled_it/">DEF CON 32 kicked off</a>, drawing thousands of cybersecurity professionals, AI enthusiasts, and corporate decision-makers from across the globe.

The agency played a pivotal role in the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) Semifinal Competition, which put hackers through their paces as they attempted to secure critical infrastructure in a hypothetical city. This exercise underscored the increasing concern over AI&rsquo;s role in national security and the need for advanced defenses against potential AI-driven threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft and the Growing Threat of &lsquo;Promptware&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.zenity.io/">Zenity</a> CTO <a href="https://il.linkedin.com/in/michaelbargury">Michael Bargury's</a> briefing at Black Hat brought attention to the rising dangers associated with generative AI, particularly in the form of &ldquo;<a href="https://pypi.org/project/promptware/">promptware</a>.&rdquo; This term refers to the security risks that arise when malicious actors use prompt injection techniques to manipulate AI systems, such as <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Copilot</a>. Bargury's demonstration highlighted how attackers could hijack Copilot by poisoning the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models that feed its AI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He also discussed the challenges facing security teams in defending against these new threats. His recommendations included stricter controls over AI system access and enhanced monitoring to detect unusual behavior, especially from insiders who might exploit these systems for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>New Tools and Technologies: Flashpoint and CalypsoAI Lead the Charge</strong></p>
<p>Several companies used Black Hat as a platform to launch new products and updates aimed at bolstering cybersecurity defenses. <a href="https://flashpointarchive.org/">Flashpoint</a>, for instance, introduced enhancements to its Flashpoint Ignite and Echosec platforms, adding features such as investigations management and real-time threat updates.

However, the Mac app lagged behind, failing to receive updates for nearly a year and still retaining the old "Twitter" branding. This lack of attention and modernization might have contributed to its current predicament.</p>
<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s Next for X on MacOS?</strong></h3>
<p>The future of X&rsquo;s functionality on MacOS remains uncertain. With the app no longer available for download and the company yet to issue any statement, users are left in limbo. Tech enthusiasts and X&rsquo;s user base are keenly awaiting updates from the company, hoping for clarity on whether the app will be reinstated or if there are plans for a revamped version. Until then, the browser-based version remains the primary option for Mac users who want to stay connected to the platform.</p>
<p>The disappearance of X from the Mac App Store has left a significant gap in the user experience, marking a potential turning point in the app's journey on MacOS. Whether this is a temporary glitch or a permanent farewell to the Mac app, only time and the company's forthcoming communications will tell.</p>25:T1a41,<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arizona-Mexico Relations at the Forefront</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Last week, a high-profile U.S. congressional delegation met with Mexican President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Manuel_L%C3%B3pez_Obrador">Andrés Manuel López </a>Obrador and President-elect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Sheinbaum">Claudia Sheinbaum</a> in Mexico City to fortify ties between Arizona and Mexico ahead of Mexico's presidential transition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly">Senator Mark Kelly</a> and Representative Greg Stanton, both Democrats from Arizona, joined the bipartisan, bicameral delegation. Their discussions focused on critical issues including migration, water resources, and nearshoring, the strategic relocation of business operations from the U.S. to Mexico.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Historic Delegation Visit</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stanton noted that this was the most significant delegation to visit Mexico City since Sheinbaum's election and likely the last before her inauguration in October. "She was genuinely interested in enhancing the working relationship with the United States and members of Congress," Stanton remarked. "The meeting was productive both in terms of relationship building and substantive discussion."</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Sheinbaum's Historic Win</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><u>Claudia</u>&nbsp;Sheinbaum made history as Mexico&rsquo;s first female president-elect following an election marked by unprecedented voter participation. On June 2, nearly 60 million Mexicans voted, electing a record number of women and a majority of left-wing candidates from the ruling party, Morena.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Arizona-Mexico Economic Bonds</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stanton highlighted that the discussions heavily centered on Arizona's economic ties with Mexico. "We talked extensively about building a long-term and durable security relationship in North America involving the United States, Mexico, and Canada," he said. This includes efforts to reduce migrant flows to the U.S. southern border, a priority for the current U.S. administration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Migrant Flow Reduction Success</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stanton pointed out that migrant crossings between border points of entry are at their lowest since President Joe Biden took office. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data, June 2024 had the fewest encounters on the southwest border since 2021, with a 24% decrease from May and a 27% drop from April.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Combatting Fentanyl Trafficking</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A top priority for the delegation is curbing the influx of fentanyl and other drugs from Mexico. Fentanyl is the deadliest drug in Arizona, responsible for 60% of drug-related deaths, as reported by Jeff Johnston, Maricopa County's chief medical examiner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Enhancing Security for the World Cup</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Stanton also emphasized the importance of mitigating the flow of weapons into North America and strengthening continental security. With North America hosting the World Cup, close cooperation is essential to ensure a safe experience for international visitors. "We can use World Cup security as a model for long-term security collaboration," Stanton suggested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nearshoring: Economic Integration Opportunity</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The semiconductor industry&rsquo;s growth in Arizona was another key topic. Stanton noted that the U.S. and Mexico are well-positioned to develop a robust supply chain that benefits both economies. "This is a nearshoring moment, an opportunity for North America to capitalize on tensions with China and grow the semiconductor industry," Stanton said. <a href="https://www.azcommerce.com/industries/manufacturing/semiconductor-advantages/">Since 2020</a>, Arizona's semiconductor industry has attracted over $102 billion in capital investment and created more than 15,700 jobs, according to the Arizona Commerce Authority.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Shared Water Resources</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a href="https://www.watereducation.org/aquapedia/mexico-and-colorado-river-water">Water issues</a> were also a major focus, particularly the shared use of the Colorado River, vital to cities in both countries. The Water Treaty of 1944 guarantees Mexico over 488 million gallons of Colorado River water annually. This agreement is crucial as the U.S. works to prevent critical reservoir levels, ensuring water and energy security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Broader Diplomatic Engagements</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The delegation also met with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar, Mexico's Finance Minister Rogelio Ramírez de la O, and future Foreign Affairs Secretary Juan Ramón de la Fuente, among others. They visited a migrant shelter and participated in a human rights roundtable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The visit included eight Democratic senators and representatives from various states and one Republican senator from Indiana. As a goodwill gesture, the Arizona delegates presented Sheinbaum with a book by Arizona Poet Laureate Alberto Ríos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Strengthening Historic Relationships</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Senator Kelly emphasized the visit's significance, especially with Mexico preparing for its first female president. "This visit was vital to deepen cooperation on migration, security, trade, and economic development," Kelly stated. He is considered a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With Arizona as a key swing state and a large Latino voter base, the relationship with Mexico remains crucial. "Mexico is one of our most important economic partners, and we see it daily in Arizona through cross-border commerce," Kelly added. "I look forward to partnering with President-elect Sheinbaum to address our shared challenges and strengthen our historic ties."</span></p>26:T187e,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Background and Impact</span></strong></h4>

<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In early January, <strong><a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/two-students-uncover-security-bug-160516135.html">Alexander Sherbrooke and Iakov Taranenko</a></strong>, two university students from UC Santa Cruz, discovered a significant security vulnerability in the internet-connected laundry machines managed by CSC ServiceWorks. This flaw allows anyone to remotely command the machines to operate laundry cycles for free. The students stumbled upon this vulnerability while conducting research and immediately recognized its potential for misuse.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Eureka Moment</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Sherbrooke described the moment of discovery as surreal. "I was sitting on the floor of my basement laundry room with my laptop and suddenly had an &lsquo;oh s&mdash;&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; he recalled. By running a simple script, Sherbrooke was able to instruct the laundry machine to start a cycle despite having no funds in his laundry account. The machine responded instantly, prompting him to <strong><a href="https://www.coursehero.com/file/p7u7go1e/As-a-result-Im-forced-to-move-with-added-care-no-matter-what-Im-doingeven-things/">&ldquo;PUSH START&rdquo; for a free laundry cycle.</a></strong></span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Exploiting the Flaw</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In another experiment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherbrooke"><strong>Sherbrooke</strong> </a>and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Taranenko">Taranenko</a></strong> managed to inflate one of their laundry accounts with several million dollars, a balance that appeared normal in the CSC Go mobile app. This demonstrated the severity of the vulnerability, highlighting that anyone could exploit the flaw to access unlimited laundry services without paying.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Reporting the Issue</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Despite the critical nature of their discovery, CSC ServiceWorks did not have a dedicated security reporting page. The students attempted to report the flaw through the company&rsquo;s online contact form and even made a phone call, but they received no response. Frustrated by the lack of acknowledgment, they turned to the CERT Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University, which assists in disclosing security vulnerabilities.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Public Disclosure</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">After waiting beyond the typical three-month period that security researchers allow for vendors to address issues, Sherbrooke and Taranenko revealed their findings publicly. They first presented their research at their university's cybersecurity club in May. Their presentation outlined how the vulnerability in the CSC Go app's API allowed them to bypass security checks and send commands directly to CSC&rsquo;s servers.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Technical Details of the Flaw</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The flaw lies in the API used by the CSC Go app, which communicates with laundry machines over the internet. When users top up their accounts or start laundry cycles through the app, the API sends commands to CSC's servers. The students discovered that the app performs security checks locally on the user's device, and CSC&rsquo;s servers automatically trust these checks. By intercepting and manipulating the network traffic, Sherbrooke and Taranenko could bypass the app's security and send unauthorized commands to the servers.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Potential Risks and Impact</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">While free laundry might seem like a harmless benefit, the researchers emphasized the broader risks. The vulnerability could potentially allow malicious actors to control heavy-duty appliances, posing safety hazards such as overheating and fires. Although the machines require a physical button press to start a cycle, the ability to manipulate settings remotely without oversight is concerning.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">CSC&rsquo;s Response and Inaction</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Following their report, CSC quietly reset the inflated account balance but did not fix the underlying vulnerability. The lack of response from the company left the students disheartened. Taranenko expressed his frustration, questioning how a company of CSC's size could overlook such critical security flaws and fail to provide a means for reporting them.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Moving Forward</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Despite the lack of response from CSC, Sherbrooke and Taranenko remain committed to ethical hacking and improving cybersecurity. They believe their efforts, though unacknowledged, highlight the importance of robust security practices in connected devices. Taranenko noted the experience as valuable real-world practice, contrasting it with simulated cybersecurity competitions.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Conclusion</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The discovery by Sherbrooke and Taranenko underscores the vulnerabilities present in IoT devices and the importance of responsive security protocols. Their experience serves as a reminder for companies to maintain open channels for reporting security issues and to take prompt action in addressing them. As technology continues to advance, ensuring the security of interconnected devices will be crucial in preventing exploitation and maintaining user trust.</span></h4>28:T10e0,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Bridging the Gap Between Devices</span></strong></h4>

This innovation introduces a chip capable of self-destructing when tampered with, representing a significant leap forward in safeguarding against hack attacks and counterfeit threats.</h4>
<h4>IoT devices face numerous security challenges, one of which involves the provisioning of cryptographic keys. These keys are crucial for protecting a device's data and operations. However, the process of provisioning keys can be complex and costly. The newly introduced chip addresses this challenge by allowing keys to be generated internally within the chip itself, using either an internal random number generator (RNG) or a physically unclonable function (PUF). PUFs operate similarly to unique digital fingerprints for each chip, offering a more secure method of generating and storing secrets.</h4>
<h4>PUFs represent a significant advancement in hardware security, utilizing the unique characteristics of individual transistors to safeguard against attacks. The research team, led by Eric Hunt-Schroeder in collaboration with Marvell Technology, demonstrated how PUFs can defend against sophisticated attacks, including those involving physical access to a device's circuit board.</h4>
<h4>However, the most intriguing feature of the new technology is its ability to self-destruct when compromised. By increasing the voltage across circuits, the system triggers electromigration, disrupting the flow of electricity and rendering the chip inoperable. This ensures that if a device is tampered with, it becomes useless, protecting sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Hunt-Schroeder was inspired to develop this self-destruct mechanism after discovering that PUFs could be cloned using advanced techniques, highlighting the need for a more robust defense against counterfeiting and unauthorized access.</h4>
<h4>In addition to enhancing device security, the new technology presents a formidable barrier against counterfeit chips. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, advancements in cybersecurity are essential for protecting the integrity of devices and the privacy of individuals and organizations. The technology showcased at the IEEE ISSCC represents a significant milestone in the ongoing battle against cyber threats, offering a glimpse into the future of hardware security.</h4>
<h4>By introducing a chip capable of self-destructing when tampered with, researchers have taken a significant step towards bolstering the defenses of IoT devices. This innovation not only enhances device security but also serves as a deterrent against counterfeit reproduction. As technology evolves, it is crucial to stay ahead of emerging threats and continue developing innovative solutions to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of digital ecosystems.</h4>36:Tcf3,<h4>Elon Musk has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, asserting that they have strayed from the startup's original altruistic mission of developing artificial intelligence (AI) for the betterment of humanity, instead prioritizing profit. The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco on Thursday, marks the culmination of Musk's long standing opposition to the company he helped found, which has garnered attention as a leading entity in generative AI, largely due to substantial funding from Microsoft.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Musk's legal complaint alleges breach of contract, contending that Altman and co-founder Greg Brockman initially approached him to establish an open-source, nonprofit organization. However, Musk asserts that OpenAI, founded in 2015, has shifted its focus to profit generation. According to Musk, the original agreement centered on advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) in a manner that would benefit humanity, in direct opposition to Google, which Musk believed was pursuing AGI for profit-driven purposes and posed significant risks.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of deviating from the founding agreement by releasing its GPT-4 language model as essentially a Microsoft product in 2023. Musk seeks legal recourse to compel OpenAI to make its research and technology public while preventing the startup from leveraging its assets, including GPT-4, for Microsoft's financial gain. Additionally, Musk seeks to classify GPT-4 and a new technology known as Q* as AGI, thereby excluding them from Microsoft's licensing rights to OpenAI.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>OpenAI, Microsoft, and Musk have not responded to Reuters' requests for comment regarding the lawsuit. Musk's legal action comes amid increased scrutiny of OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft for potential antitrust violations in the United States and Britain. The startup's internal conflicts, culminating in Altman's sudden removal and subsequent return, have prompted the formation of a new temporary board, with plans to appoint new board members in March.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Despite Musk's allegations, some legal experts question the strength of his case, particularly regarding the validity of the alleged contract breach based on an email exchange between Musk and Altman. Brian Quinn, a law professor at Boston College Law School, suggests that Musk's reliance on a single email as the basis for the contract may not withstand legal scrutiny.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Meanwhile, Musk has launched his own AI endeavor, xAI, comprising engineers recruited from leading technology firms like Google and Microsoft. The startup introduced Grok, a ChatGPT competitor, for Premium+ subscribers of Musk's social media platform X in December. Musk aims to develop what he calls a "maximum truth-seeking AI," emphasizing the importance of responsible AI development to mitigate potential risks to humanity and society.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>While ChatGPT has found widespread use across various industries, Musk and other AI experts have advocated for caution in advancing systems more powerful than GPT-4, citing potential dangers. As the legal battle unfolds, the future of AI development and its societal impact remain subjects of intense scrutiny and debate.</h4>37:Tc91,<h4>The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) has verified that hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in Ivanti&rsquo;s extensively utilized enterprise VPN appliance have directed attacks towards organizations within the U.S. defense sector.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>NSA representative Edward Bennett confirmed via email to TechCrunch on Friday that the intelligence agency, in collaboration with its interagency partners, is actively monitoring and acknowledging the broad repercussions stemming from the recent exploitation of Ivanti products, including within the U.S. defense sector.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>"The NSA's Cybersecurity Collaboration Center is persistently collaborating with our partners to identify and mitigate this activity," the spokesperson elaborated.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The confirmation of NSA surveillance on these cyberattacks surfaced shortly after Mandiant revealed that suspected Chinese espionage hackers have conducted "massive attempts" to exploit numerous vulnerabilities affecting Ivanti Connect Secure, a popular remote access VPN software widely employed by countless corporations and large entities across the globe.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Earlier this week, Mandiant disclosed that the China-affiliated hackers, identified as UNC5325, had targeted a spectrum of industries, including the U.S. defense industrial base sector, which encompasses a global network of private sector entities supplying equipment and services to the U.S. military. These findings were sourced from earlier reports by security firm Volexity.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In its analysis, Mandiant underscored UNC5325's extensive familiarity with the Ivanti Connect Secure appliance, along with their utilization of living-off-the-land techniques to enhance evasion of detection. Additionally, the hackers have deployed innovative malware to maintain presence within Ivanti devices, even post factory resets, system upgrades, and patches.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>This assessment was echoed in an advisory issued by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) on Thursday, cautioning that threat actors exploiting vulnerable Ivanti VPN appliances could retain root-level persistence even after executing factory resets. According to CISA's independent tests, attackers can effectively deceive Ivanti's Integrity Checker Tool, potentially resulting in a failure to identify compromise.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Responding to CISA's revelations, Ivanti's Chief Information Security Officer, Mike Riemer, downplayed the agency's findings, expressing doubt that CISA's tests would replicate real-world customer environments. Riemer further stated that Ivanti has no knowledge of any successful threat actor persistence following the implementation of security updates and factory resets as recommended.</h4>

<h4>"It takes a lot of energy to move data back and forth, especially with today's computing workloads," said Xiangjin Wu, a doctoral candidate at Stanford. "With this memory, we hope to bring processing and memory closer together into one device, using less energy and time."</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Creating a universal memory that can store data for a long time and process it quickly with low power has challenges. However, the new phase-change memory developed at Stanford is a significant step forward. The researchers hope it will encourage further development and adoption as a universal memory.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The memory relies on a material called GST467, made of four parts germanium, six parts antimony, and seven parts tellurium. The researchers found ways to layer this material with other thin materials in a superlattice structure, achieving good nonvolatile memory results.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>"The unique composition of GST467 gives it a fast switching speed," said Asir Intisar Khan, co-lead author on the paper. "Integrating it within the superlattice structure in nanoscale devices enables low switching energy, good endurance, stability, and nonvolatility."</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong>Setting New Standards</strong></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The GST467 superlattice meets several important benchmarks. It is highly stable over time, operates at below 1 volt for low power, and is significantly faster than a typical solid-state drive.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>"A few other types of memory can be a bit faster, but they operate at higher voltage or higher power," said Eric Pop. "The fact that we're switching at a few tens of nanoseconds while operating below one volt is a big deal."</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The superlattice also packs a good amount of memory cells into a small space. The researchers have shrunk the memory cells to 40 nanometers in diameter, less than half the size of a coronavirus. Although not as dense as it could be, the researchers are exploring ways to stack the memory in vertical layers, thanks to the superlattice's low fabrication temperature.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><em>"The fabrication temperature is well below what you need," Pop said. "This type of memory can enable future 3D layering."</em></h4>42:T7f3,<h4>Hummingbirds AI, a top player in Vision AI, pleasantly surprised attendees at the AI Cyberwar event by introducing their latest creation, GuacamoleBrowser.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Rather than focusing on DNA sequences, the study delved into epigenetic profiles &ndash; the on/off switches within cells that influence gene expression and, in this case, contribute to tumor formation. HGSOC originates in the fallopian tubes and is known for its resistance to chemotherapy.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Using a comprehensive multi-omics analysis, the researchers predicted abnormal behavior in factors controlling gene expression during the transition from normal to cancerous cells. Testing these predictions revealed that certain proteins, specifically the AP-1 complex, were excessively active in cancerous cells, promoting the growth and spread of cancer. Another set of proteins, the GATA family, which typically regulates cell behavior, was found to be less effective in cancerous cells.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The analysis pinpointed key genes &ndash; MAF, GATA6, and DAB2 &ndash; that play a crucial role in controlling cancer growth. These genes were epigenetically suppressed during early tumorigenesis, contributing to tumor formation. Identifying the suppression of these genes led to the realization that excessive Ras activation was the culprit. The researchers tested the clinically applicable drug trametinib, a MEK inhibitor that can inhibit Ras signaling, and observed signs of normal epigenetic control, indicating potential effectiveness in preventing tumorigenesis in ovarian cancer.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Moreover, the suppressed genes MAF, GATA6, and DAB2 were identified as potential biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. According to Machino, these findings not only offer new therapeutic approaches but also hold the promise of significant societal impact, providing hope in the quest for more effective treatments for this deadly form of cancer.</h4>45:T6f8,<p><strong><em>A Game-Changer for Growth and Customer Experience!</em></strong></p>

Russian hackers have gained notoriety for deploying sophisticated techniques to disrupt Ukrainian networks and infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, a recent incident has brought a new, less sophisticated but effective method into the spotlight: radio commands to halt Poland's railway system, a crucial transit infrastructure for NATO in supporting Ukraine.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Railway Cyberattack</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On August 25 and 26, 20 of Poland's trains carrying passengers and freight stopped in what has been described as a "cyberattack." These incidents have raised alarms as they directly impact the movement of essential resources to bolster Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The saboteurs behind this disruption are suspected to be in support of Russia. They not only interrupted the railway system but also incorporated elements of the Russian national anthem and speeches by President Vladimir Putin into their commands. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Polish intelligence services have launched an investigation into these incidents.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Closer Look at the Attack</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite initially labeling this event as a "cyberattack," cybersecurity experts like Lukasz Olejnik point out that it involved no cyber elements. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instead, the saboteurs exploited a vulnerability in the railway's communication system, sending simple "radio-stop" commands via radio frequency to the targeted trains.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poland's trains use a radio system without encryption or authentication for these commands. Olejnik explains that anyone with minimal equipment, costing as little as $30, could broadcast the radio-stop commands to a Polish train, which triggers their emergency stop function. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This method's simplicity is underscored by the fact that the frequencies and tones required are publicly known and have been discussed in online forums for years.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This limitation suggests that the saboteurs had to be relatively close to the trains they targeted, making logistics a critical challenge in carrying out such operations.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Response and Future Security</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poland's national transportation agency plans to upgrade its railway systems by 2025 to use more secure <strong><a title="GSM cellular radios" href="https://www.globalspec.com/reference/66230/203279/gsm-radio">GSM cellular radios</a></strong>, which offer encryption and authentication. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, until this transition is complete, the relatively unprotected VHF 150 MHz system will remain in use, leaving room for potential attacks of this nature.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the disruption caused by the radio attack, there have been no reported injuries or significant damage. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The railway agency reassured passengers that there was no immediate threat to their safety.</span></p>

<p>This development has been in progress since around 2020 when tech enthusiasts spotted alterations in the code that hinted at Google's intention to introduce a new browser called 'Lacros' to replace the current Chrome browser as the default Chromebook option.</p>
<p>Fast forward three years and the Lacros project might be edging closer to completion. Recent reports suggest that Lacros is now ready for mainstream deployment.</p>
<p>According to <a title="insights" href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chromeos-116-may-begin-the-lacros-browser-push-to-chromebooks/?expand_article=1">insights</a> from About Chromebooks, changes in the <strong>ChromeOS</strong> codebase strongly imply that the transition to Lacros could commence alongside the launch of ChromeOS 116.</p>
<p>Currently, users of older ChromeOS versions must manually enable two experimental flags to access and use the Lacros browser. However, indications from documentation related to ChromeOS 116 point towards a forthcoming change.</p>
<p>Also Read, <a title="What is Windows S Mode and Should I Disable It" href="../startup-insights/what-is-windows-s-mode">What is Windows S Mode and Should I Disable It</a></p>
<p>With the widespread availability of ChromeOS 116, the browser may be automatically enabled as the default, eliminating the need for users to toggle the flags manually.</p>
<p>The report further highlights that <strong>ChromeOS 116 beta</strong> contains numerous references to Lacros. Notably, in this operating system iteration, setting the new browser as the default is no longer a user-configurable option, as one of the required flags has been removed.</p>
<p>While this adjustment might merely signify a tidying up of Lacros-related elements before the official launch, it could also signify Google's steady approach towards phasing out the traditional Chrome browser in favor of Lacros within the upcoming version of ChromeOS.</p>
<p>For those curious about Lacros, it represents a Linux variant of the Chrome browser, boasting enhanced Wayland support. Google's official documentation explains that Lacros stands for 'Linux And <strong>Chrome OS</strong>.' Its purpose is to offer users a consistent experience akin to running Chrome on a conventional Chromebook.</p>
<p>Transitioning from Chrome to Lacros as the default browser on Chromebooks is a strategic maneuver for Google. This change could streamline the update process, thereby facilitating the deployment of browser patches.</p>
<p>Currently, any modifications to the browser necessitate a complete ChromeOS update, which could be more efficient and pose a challenge when addressing critical browser vulnerabilities that require immediate patching. The introduction of Lacros is set to simplify this process, ultimately leading to smoother update experiences in future ChromeOS iterations.</p>

<p>Google's decision to separate the Chrome browser and ChromeOS on Chromebooks using Linux showcases the company's commitment to innovation and efficiency. The anticipated launch of Lacros as the default browser has the potential to revolutionize the update process and enhance user experiences on Chromebooks.</p>55:T10b1,<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most frustrating aspects of Windows 11 is the plethora of unwanted apps and games that come pre-installed on your PC. However, a new trick has surfaced that allows you to install Windows 11 without all that annoying bloatware.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As reported by Windows Latest, executing this trick is remarkably simple. During the setup process, you must set your region to English (World) or European English in the 'Time and currency format' drop-down list. This causes a unique issue where Windows 11's setup services fail to communicate with Microsoft's services due to using specific language codes (en-001 and en-150).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consequently, an "OOBEREGION" error message appears, but fear not, you can select 'Skip' to continue the installation process. The result is a fresh Windows 11 installation without unnecessary bloatware, leaving only the essential apps.</span></p>

<h2><strong>Let's delve a bit deeper into the world of Bloatware</strong></h2>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"Bloatware"</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;refers to pre-installed apps and games that come with your devices, often from major manufacturers. When you first boot up Windows 11 on a new PC or laptop, you'll likely encounter a host of additional applications, including trial versions of antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some of these pre-installed apps may serve a purpose for specific users, most people find them redundant and unnecessary, taking up valuable space on the hard drive and slowing down Windows during startup. Moreover, they can cause annoying pop-up notifications, pushing users to subscribe to their services.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unfortunately, Microsoft has also joined the trend of including unwanted apps in their installations. Even if you build your PC or perform a clean Windows 11 installation, you will likely encounter these bloatware apps.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"<a title="OOBEREGION" href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-oobekeyboard-oobelocal-ooberegion-errors-on-windows-11-10">OOBEREGION</a>"</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;workaround is an essential discovery for users seeking a cleaner and streamlined experience. Installing Windows 11 through Microsoft's software and following the trick allows you to enjoy a bloatware-free version of the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It's worth noting that this workaround may have a limited shelf life. Windows Latest reports that a Microsoft spokesperson acknowledged the issue and is looking into it. Thus, the company may patch this workaround in a forthcoming Windows 11 update. As disappointing as this might be, it's not entirely surprising. Like laptop manufacturers, Microsoft might benefit from promoting pre-installed apps and games through financial incentives.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Moreover, this workaround exploits an underlying issue in how Microsoft's services handle specific language codes, and the company will likely be keen on resolving it to avoid potential side effects.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In conclusion, the&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"OOBEREGION"</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;trick is a valuable discovery for Windows 11 users who want a bloatware-free experience. However, as Microsoft may address this workaround in the future, users should take advantage of it to enjoy a cleaner Windows 11 installation.</span></p>

The much-awaited release was initially announced during the Google I/O 2023 event, generating excitement among users eager to leverage the popular messaging platform on their smartwatches.</p>
<p>The <strong>new smartwatch version of WhatsApp</strong> boasts many of the functionalities found on its smartphone counterpart. WearOS users can now send and receive texts, voice messages, emojis, and quick replies seamlessly without pairing their smartwatch with a smartphone. This standalone capability offers greater convenience to users, especially those who prefer leaving their phones behind during certain activities.</p>
<p>Moreover, WhatsApp on WearOS maintains its reputation for secure communication by providing end-to-end encryption for all messages.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to note that the WearOS version of WhatsApp has some limitations compared to other platforms. Users won't have access to certain large-scale features, such as Communities, and VoIP calls are currently unavailable; the app can only receive them.</p>
<p>Head to the Google Play Store and install the app to get WhatsApp up and running on your smartwatch. However, there's a caveat: your <a title="wearable must be running" href="../top-news/samsung-smartwatch-capable-of-fast-charging">wearable must be running</a> on WearOS 3, which means owners of older WearOS devices will miss out on this functionality.</p>
<p>As for Apple Watch users, there has been no official confirmation from Meta (formerly Facebook) regarding a WhatsApp app for the popular smartwatch. IOS users must continue using the traditional method of responding to messages through their iPhones.</p>
<h2>Exciting Future Updates for WearOS</h2>
<p>The release of WhatsApp on WearOS is just the beginning of an exciting wave of updates for the platform. During Google I/O 2023, it was revealed that three new Spotify tiles would be "coming soon" to WearOS. These tiles will enable users to directly access and play new podcast episodes, view their music rotation, and enjoy a playlist curated by the service's AI DJ. This integration with Spotify is expected to enhance the overall user experience on WearOS devices, making them even more appealing to music and podcast enthusiasts.</p>
<h3>WhatsApp's Timely Launch and Galaxy Unpacked Event</h3>
<p>The timing of WhatsApp's release on WearOS is particularly intriguing due to an upcoming event by Samsung. On July 26, Samsung is set to host its second Galaxy Unpacked event, during which it is highly anticipated that the tech giant will unveil its newest foldable phones. While there has been speculation about the potential launch of the Galaxy Watch 6 during the event, nothing has been confirmed yet.</p>

<p>Interestingly, WhatsApp was initially slated to be released on WearOS shortly after the Google I/O 2023 event. However, the release got pushed back by a couple of months, aligning it with the week before Galaxy Unpacked. This has led some to speculate that the delay was a strategic move to build anticipation for Samsung's flagship wearable, the <a title="Galaxy Watch 6" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/galaxy-watch-6-samsung-wearable-chip/">Galaxy Watch 6</a>. With WhatsApp's massive user base worldwide, it is plausible that the delayed release aimed to generate interest in smartwatches, particularly the Galaxy Watch 6.</p>
<p>While it remains uncertain if the speculations hold any truth, many are hopeful that Samsung's next-generation wearable will debut during the highly-anticipated Galaxy Unpacked event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>58:Td2c,<p>Since its launch on Wednesday night, Instagram Thread has already garnered over 23 million sign-ups, as confirmed by the badges displayed on Instagram when new users join this exciting app.</p>
<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said <strong>Instagram Thread</strong>&nbsp;achieved an impressive milestone of <a title="10 million sign-ups within seven hours" href="https://www.threads.net/t/CuWNIVrt78c/">10 million sign-ups within seven hours</a>. While this number falls short of major social networks like Twitter and Instagram, it undoubtedly sets the stage for Thread&nbsp;to gain significant momentum and make its mark in the digital landscape.</p>
<p>However, surpassing Twitter's prominence and cultural impact is challenging for Threads.</p>
<p>Instagram head, Adam Mosseri, shared his insights in a candid video posted from what seemed to be his bed, saying, "It's relatively easy to attract sign-ups, but building a platform that users truly engage with and continuously return to is the real challenge. Quite a great first day."</p>
<p>Despite its early success, Instagram Thread remains a simple platform with limited features compared to Twitter. For instance, it lacks direct messaging capabilities and only displays a feed of posts recommended by the app.</p>
<p>In a series of responses on Threads, Mosseri acknowledged that the platform still has many "basic" features in development, including a feed that exclusively showcases posts from users that one follows. Additionally, the team is actively working on incorporating search functionality and hashtags.</p>
<p>An area of concern is the moderation of the app. While <strong>Threads for Instagram</strong> initially launched with some self-moderation features, such as the ability to hide specific words and phrases, it remains to be seen how effectively the platform can tackle moderation challenges.</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google's chief of search, Prabhakar Raghavan, said that when staff members inquired about the Reddit outages and their effects on search results, users are dissatisfied.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Raghavan, the business is testing several methods to enhance search results and provide more reliable information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social media platforms TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Quora will all have discussion forums and videos surfaced by Google's new Perspectives feature, which was unveiled on Monday.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google users have long been capable of improving their search results by including the term "Reddit" to find helpful data on specific topics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when numerous Reddit forums went offline earlier this month, this tactic lost its effectiveness. Many pages in search results suddenly became inaccessible or unhelpful because moderators of some popular forums made their pages private as part of a widespread protest against Reddit's decision to charge developers for data access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this issue, Google has introduced a new feature called</span><a href="https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-perspectives/"> <strong>Perspectives</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was unveiled on Monday. The Perspectives tab, which is currently available in the United States on mobile web and the Google app, seeks to surface discussion forums and videos from social media sites such as TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, and Quora.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Google's senior vice president of search, Prabhakar Raghavan, addressed user frustration and discussed the company's efforts to display useful information in search results without that require users to add "Reddit" to their searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raghavan acknowledged the need to improve user satisfaction and responded to an employee's comment about negative user feedback, which mentioned excessive ads and irrelevant results. He emphasized the importance of enhancing the user experience on the core Google search product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google is currently working on revamping its search capabilities to keep up with competitors and leverage the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence. This involves providing more sophisticated and conversational answers to text-based queries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its annual developer conference in May, Google announced its experimentation with a project called Search Generative Experience, which aims to deliver more comprehensive and in-depth results powered by generative AI. Additionally, Google introduced Bard, a ChatGPT competitor, earlier this year. <a title="Google Bard is still isolated from the rest of the world" href="../software/google-bard-write-code-in-various-programming-languages">Google Bard is still isolated from the rest of the world</a> and in experimental mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another employee at the companywide meeting raised a question about the difficulty of finding "authentic discussion" due to the "Reddit blackout."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CEO Sundar Pichai chimed in, stating that users prioritize "more comprehensive answers" over "blue links." This explains why they include the name of forum sites like Reddit in their searches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HJ Kim, vice president of engineering in search, acknowledged the demand for more content from sites like Reddit and mentioned the Perspectives tab as one of the features developed by Google in response. However, Kim acknowledged that there is room for improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim emphasized the efforts made by Google's cross-functional teams to address this type of content over the past few years, particularly concerning Reddit. He expressed the company's commitment to doing a better job and determining which strategies yield the best results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Raghavan further explained the concept behind Perspectives, highlighting the aim to provide immediate answers for questions with multiple opinions, rather than appending additional information. The early engagement with this approach has been positive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While Google invests significant time and resources in AI, Raghavan emphasized that it alone cannot fully resolve this issue. The company is running experiments and Perspectives is one example of its commitment to addressing emerging needs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman, stated that search already satisfies most user needs and that Google is continuously improving Search to meet evolving requirements. The Perspectives filter is one of the features that contribute to ensuring users find the most helpful information from a variety of sources and formats on Google.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion, Google's introduction of the Perspectives feature reflects the company's dedication to enhancing the search experience by surfacing valuable discussions and videos from various <a title="social media platforms" href="../startup-insights/Top-Benefits-of-Web-Analytics-to-business-growth">social media platforms</a>. Through ongoing improvements and experimentation, Google aims to provide users with more comprehensive answers and address emerging needs effectively.</span></p>5a:T1719,<div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654] sm:AIPRM__conversation__response">

<p>A recent forecast by Forrester Research predicts that advertising agencies will witness a replacement of 7.5% of their jobs with automation by 2030. This transformation is primarily attributed to the increasing prominence of generative <a title="artificial intelligence" href="https://www.executiveheadlines.com/it-services/Most-powerful-artificial-intelligence-tool-in-the-world">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in the industry. According to the report, approximately one-third of agency jobs will be at risk of being replaced within the next decade.</p>
<h2><strong>Threats to Specific Job Roles</strong></h2>
<p>Generative AI poses a significant threat to clerical, secretarial, and administrative roles within advertising agencies, which are expected to account for 28% of job losses. Additionally, sales and similar positions are projected to contribute to 22% of the anticipated losses, while market research and related fields represent 18% of the overall impact.</p>
<h3><strong>Higher-Paid Positions: Increased Productivity, Not Automation</strong></h3>
<p>Interestingly, jobs that heavily rely on generative AI, such as editors, writers, and programmers, exhibit a negative correlation with automation potential. Forrester's findings suggest that these higher-paid and better-educated roles may experience increased productivity instead of being fully automated. Consequently, this could lead to the emergence of smaller yet more capable agencies in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>Generative AI's Impact on the Advertising Industry</strong></h3>
<p>Generative AI has become a focal point within the advertising industry in 2023, fueling both fear and excitement while instigating a competitive race to gain an early advantage in this domain.</p>
<p>Forrester's forecast, released during the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, aims to dispel pessimism surrounding AI's encroachment on creative work in agencies. However, the research highlights that numerous agency jobs are still under threat, with an estimated 33,000 positions (7.5%) expected to be lost to automation by the 2030s.</p>
<h3><strong>Adoption of Generative AI in Marketing</strong></h3>
<p>Tools such as <a title="OpenAI's ChatGPT" href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a> and DALL-E have rapidly introduced generative AI to the advertising landscape. These technologies enable the quick production of lifelike copy and visuals based on user prompts.</p>
<p>As per Forrester data, approximately 56% of business-to-consumer marketers have already embraced generative AI, with an additional 40% currently exploring its potential applications. Notably, Coca-Cola recently ran a campaign allowing consumers and artists to leverage OpenAI's tools to create new ads using the brand's library of assets.</p>
<p>Advertising agencies, including WPP and chipmaker Nvidia, are also actively integrating generative AI into their operations, emphasizing the potential for large-scale creative asset production.</p>
<h3><strong>Job Security for Creative Professionals</strong></h3>
<p>While speculations abound regarding the threat automation poses to creative roles, Forrester's findings suggest that creative jobs, including writers and editors, might be among the least vulnerable.</p>
<p>Although generative AI significantly influences these fields, it has the potential to enhance productivity, resulting in a mitigation of explicit job losses. Forrester predicts an increase in the share of agency jobs related to creative positions, as well as growth in professions such as data science, management, software development, public relations, and market research.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at a global level, Forrester anticipates that digital marketing and strategy specialists will experience a headcount expansion of over 20% by 2028.</p>
<h3><strong>The Role of Originality and Automation Potential</strong></h3>
<p>According to the report, "Forrester finds that originality is the most significant factor that lowers a job's automation potential. Put another way, the more creative the role, the less likely that it can be replaced by automation." This statement highlights the value placed on creative thinking and innovative problem-solving, which are essential attributes in positions resistant to automation.</p>
<h3><strong>Evolution of Job Roles and Agency Work</strong></h3>
<p>Conversely, clerical, sales, <a title="finance" href="../industry/banking-finance">finance</a>, administrative, and labor-intensive roles will gradually occupy a smaller share of agency work in the coming years. Forrester suggests that agency headcount growth from now until 2030 is unlikely to surpass pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<h3><strong>The Future of Generative AI and Agency Jobs</strong></h3>
<p>Forrester expects the impact of generative AI on agency jobs to remain "modest" over the next two years. This is due to ongoing discussions surrounding ethical and legal issues associated with the technology, including intellectual property rights and biases.</p>
<p>However, marketers should consider integrating AI into their practices and expanding their expertise to avoid falling perilously behind in this evolving landscape.</p>

</div>5b:T1376,<p>According to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), the UK government's ambitious goal to roll out smart meters to all homes and small companies by the end of 2025 has experienced substantial delays and cost overruns.</p>
<p>This delay has caused concerns among energy companies and consumers alike, as the original deadline was almost four years ago. Let's delve deeper into the findings of the <a title="NAO report" href="https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/update-on-the-rollout-of-smart-meters/">NAO report</a> and the impact it has on various stakeholders.</p>
<h2>Delays in Implementation and Cost Overruns</h2>
<p>The NAO report reveals that energy companies have completed only 57 percent of the &pound;13.5 billion project, falling far behind the initial completion deadline.</p>
<p>This delay not only hampers the progress of the smart meter rollout but also raises concerns about the government's ability to meet its environmental and energy efficiency goals. The delay in implementation has resulted in significant cost overruns, further complicating the situation.</p>
<h3>Underwhelming Savings and Rising Energy Costs</h3>
<p>One of the key findings of the NAO report is the discrepancy between the estimated savings from smart meters and the reality faced by households. The report states that the savings amount to approximately &pound;56 per household annually, which is less than &pound;5 per month.</p>
<p>These figures fall short of the government's earlier estimate of &pound;19.5 billion in overall benefits over 20 years. This underwhelming savings figure provides little relief to households grappling with increasing energy costs.</p>
<h3>NAO's Recommendations and the Role of DESNZ</h3>
<p>Gareth Davies, Head of the NAO, stressed the importance of DESNZ working closely with energy suppliers to get the <strong><a title="smart meter" href="../iot/latin-america-smart-meter-count-triple-by-2028">smart meter</a></strong> rollout back on track. The department must have access to full information on smart meters' total costs and benefits to make informed decisions that maximize value for money.</p>
<p>This collaborative effort is crucial to ensure the benefits of smart meters are realized by millions of consumers, small businesses, and the environment, aligning with the government's wider environmental goals.</p>
<h3>Challenges Affecting Smart Meter Effectiveness</h3>
<p>While the installation progress approaches the 60 percent coverage required for electricity networks to reap the benefits of smart meters, several challenges persist. Three million meters, or 9% of all meters, are found not to be working in smart mode as anticipated according to the NAO assessment.</p>
<p>Customers have also encountered difficulties in maintaining smart functionality when switching energy suppliers. Additionally, around four million first-generation smart meters have not been moved to the central platform service, hindering their ability to retain smart capabilities during customer switches.</p>
<h3>Concerns Regarding the Central Platform Service</h3>
<p>Concerns concerning the operation of the central platform service offered by Capita subsidiary Smart DCC are raised in the NAO report. Stakeholders have reported unreliability and a perceived focus on future services rather than ensuring reliability in the present.</p>
<p>Ofgem, the energy regulator, has received stakeholder consultation responses expressing concerns about the service. With Capita currently holding the license for Smart DCC, Ofgem's responsibility lies in designing and awarding the next license, expected to extend until 2040.</p>
<h2>The Way Forward: Rectifying Challenges and Maximizing Benefits</h2>
<p>The <a title="National Audit Office" href="https://www.nao.org.uk/">National Audit Office</a> - NAO report sheds light on the slow progress, cost overruns, and functional issues plaguing the UK's smart meter rollout. With the revised deadline rapidly approaching, the government and energy suppliers must address these challenges diligently.</p>
<p>Rectifying the delays, ensuring reliability, and maximizing the benefits of smart meters should be the primary focus. By doing so, consumers, businesses, and the environment can experience the positive impact envisioned through this ambitious initiative.</p>
<p>The UK's smart meter rollout has faced significant hurdles that have hindered its progress and realization of anticipated benefits.</p>
<p>However, by actively addressing the challenges, working collaboratively, and leveraging robust information, the government and energy suppliers have an opportunity to rectify the situation and ensure a successful implementation that fulfills the promise of smart meters.</p>
<p>More: <a title="Multiple Agencies Hacked in a Broader Cyberattack: U.S Government" href="../cyber-security/agencies-hacked-in-cyberattack-usa">Multiple Agencies Hacked in a Broader Cyberattack: U.S Government</a></p>5c:Tbb6,<p>The recent cyberattack targeting several U.S. agencies and numerous organizations has raised concerns about cybersecurity. Jen Easterly, the head of the leading civilian cybersecurity watchdog, refers to the hackers responsible as a "well-known ransomware group." Let's delve into the details of this attack, its impact, and ongoing investigations.</p>
<h2>Investigating the Cyberattack Scope</h2>
<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the primary <strong><a title="civilian cybersecurity watchdog in United States" href="../cyber-security/top-leading-cybersecurity-marketing-agencies-in-the-USA">civilian cybersecurity watchdog in the United States</a></strong>, is actively investigating the extent of the cyberattacks. Eric Goldstein, the agency's executive assistant director, stated that CISA is providing support to affected federal agencies and urgently working to assess the impact and facilitate timely remediation.</p>
<h3>Exploiting Vulnerabilities in MOVEIt Software</h3>
<p>The hackers took advantage of a vulnerability in a widely used file-sharing software called MOVEIt. This program allows for fast and efficient file transfers. Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer of Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity company serving government agencies, confirmed that federal agencies had experienced data theft through the MOVEIt hacks. However, it remains uncertain whether the stolen files were sensitive or if the hackers disrupted government systems.</p>
<h3>Tracking the Hackers: CL0P</h3>
<p>CISA Director Jen Easterly identified the hackers as a well-known ransomware group. It appears that Easterly was referring to a cybercriminal organization named CL0P, which has a notorious reputation in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>
<p>Last week, both CISA and the FBI issued a joint warning about CL0P exploiting an undisclosed vulnerability in <a title="MOVEIt" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOVEit">MOVEIt</a>. The group quickly embarked on a hacking spree, compromising at least 47 organizations. They demanded payment to refrain from publishing the stolen files online, as revealed by Brett Callow, an analyst at the cybersecurity company Emsisoft.</p>
<h3>The Scale of the Attack and Ongoing Investigations</h3>
<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence has declined to comment on the cyberattack. Additionally, the National Security Council has yet to respond to requests for comment. Wendi Whitmore, who leads threat analysis at Palo Alto Networks, a prominent <strong><a title="cybersecurity company" href="../cyber-security/top-leading-cybersecurity-marketing-agencies-in-the-USA">cybersecurity company</a></strong>, described the scale of the hacking campaign as incredibly widespread, affecting hundreds, if not more, victims.</p>
<p>As this is a developing story, it is crucial to stay informed by checking back for updates on the ongoing investigations and any further implications of the cyberattack.</p>5d:T1beb,<div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654] sm:AIPRM__conversation__response">

<p>The report published by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence offers fresh insight into how U.S. intelligence agencies have capitalized on the widespread availability of for-purchase data about Americans.</p>
<h2>The Alarming Lack of Oversight in U.S. Intelligence Agencies' Acquisition of Personal Data</h2>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies are buying and storing personal information on Americans with little oversight and few guidelines, according to a <a title="government report" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23844477-odni-declassified-report-on-cai-january2022">government report</a>.</p>
<h3>Unveiling the Report: An Inside Look</h3>
<p>The report, published on Monday by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, sheds light on how U.S. intelligence agencies have leveraged the abundance of for-purchase data concerning Americans.</p>
<p>Dated January 2022, the partially declassified report highlights the potential risks associated with uncontrolled access to commercially available information (CAI). The author's identity remains redacted, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has refrained from providing further comment.</p>
<h3>Unchecked Reliance on Commercially Available Information Raises Concerns</h3>
<p>The report's findings reveal that unregulated reliance on commercially available information poses a significant threat to Americans.</p>
<h4>Revealing the Vulnerabilities of Purchased Data</h4>
<p>Commercially purchased data can expose sensitive and intimate details about individuals, encompassing personal attributes, private behavior, social connections, and speech of both U.S. and non-U.S. persons.</p>
<p>The report explicitly states that such data can be misused to invade private lives, tarnish reputations, cause emotional distress, and jeopardize personal safety. The potential power it grants to the government to intrude into private lives may surpass constitutional and social expectations, even when subjected to appropriate controls.</p>
<h3>Legal Constraints: Government vs. Private Companies</h3>
<p>While government agencies are subject to various laws that often prohibit tracking Americans without a court order or warrant, private companies that trade in personal data face minimal legal restrictions. The report refers to this data as "commercially available information" or CAI.</p>
<p>Consequently, an entire industry of data brokers has thrived by selling highly specific information about individuals. U.S. intelligence agencies can readily acquire this information from the companies that collect and package it.</p>
<h3>Extensive Usage of Commercially Available Information by U.S. Intelligence Community</h3>
<p>The report underlines the substantial reliance of the U.S. intelligence community (IC) on commercially available information for mission-related purposes, including the acquisition of social media data in some instances.</p>
<h4>Notable Instances of Government Agency Contracts</h4>
<p>The authors of the report provide numerous examples of government agencies contemplating or potentially engaging in contracts with private companies to obtain personal data.</p>
<p>The Defense Intelligence Agency, for instance, has contracted with LexisNexis, while the Navy has engaged Sayari Analytics to access a database of individuals potentially linked to sanctioned persons. Additionally, the FBI has contracted cybersecurity company ZeroFox to receive social media alerts.</p>
<h4>Government Agencies and Academic Studies</h4>
<p>The report highlights that the <strong><a title="Department of Homeland Security" href="../top-news/dhs-begins-criminal-investigation">Department of Homeland Security</a></strong> has utilized the Web of Science, a repository of academic studies, to identify foreign researchers associated with their home country's militaries.</p>
<p>As of the report's publication, the CIA was in the process of developing its policies regarding the utilization of such data. However, the agency has not yet provided an update in response to a request.</p>
<h3>International Implications: Foreign Access to Personal Data</h3>
<p>The <strong><a title="privacy risks extend beyond the US government" href="../top-news/what-is-competition-and-transparency-in-digital-advertising-act">privacy risks extend beyond the US government</a></strong> involvement, as foreign intelligence agencies also enjoy access to the data held by these private companies.</p>
<h4>Rising Concerns: China-Based Apps and Data Privacy</h4>
<p>In recent years, concerns regarding foreign government access to data on Americans have escalated, with a particular focus on China-based applications such as TikTok. While discussions around TikTok raise valid points, it is essential to recognize the broader data privacy issues that the U.S. has yet to address.</p>
<h3>Urgent Need for Enhanced Digital Privacy Protections</h3>
<p>Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon has emphasized the report's significance, urging the implementation of robust digital privacy safeguards for U.S. citizens.</p>
<h4>Wyden's Call to Action</h4>
<p>Senator Wyden, who initially requested the report's release from Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, highlighted the government's failure to establish essential safeguards for Americans' privacy.</p>
<p>Moreover, he expressed concerns over the lack of oversight regarding government agencies' acquisition and utilization of personal data. To address these issues, Wyden urged Congress to enact legislation that would regulate government purchases, impose constraints on private companies engaged in the collection and sale of personal data, and ensure that Americans' information remains out of the reach of adversaries.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the report raises alarming concerns regarding U.S. intelligence agencies' unrestricted acquisition of personal data on Americans.</p>
<p>With minimal oversight and few guidelines, the reliance on commercially available information poses significant threats to privacy and constitutional norms. Urgent action is necessary to enhance digital privacy protections and establish robust safeguards for individuals in an era of ever-increasing data availability.</p>

</div>5e:T1af2,<p><strong>YouTube attempts to steer the increasing attention of conservative pundits at LGBTQ people.</strong></p>
<p>YouTube has announced that it is demonetizing some videos on the conservative commentator Candace Owens' channel for breaking its monetization policy regarding hateful and derogatory content. This policy, the company claimed could apply to cases of misgendering or deadnaming.</p>
<p>YouTube does not publically announce any misgendering policy, however, it has stated in an announcement that it regards intentional misgendering to be a violation of its monetization policy regarding unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>In regards to occasions where she used pronouns that were not favored by transgender individuals, Owens claimed on the Candace Owens Podcast channel on Monday that YouTube had given her "a choice to remove every video that I've made concerning gender, in which I've accurately categorized someone's gender." Videos, where Owens was misgendered, were deemed "hateful behavior" by YouTube as per Owens on a portion of the episode titled "I have an announcement to make.'</p>
<p><em><strong>More: <a title="Google Announced YouTube Short Has 50 Billion Daily Views" href="../software/google-announced-youtube-shorts-has-50-billion-daily-views">Google Announced YouTube Short Has 50 Billion Daily Views</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The continuing debate over free speech and the anti-trans propaganda published by conservative media on the internet is a topic that is covered by Owens' allegations of YouTube censorship.</p>
<p>Although YouTube claimed that it didn't take away Owens's films, Michael Aciman, a Google spokesperson, confirmed Google had blocked advertisements on "several videos" on Candace Owen's YouTube channel due to violations of our policies on monetization, including the ones that prohibit hateful and sexist content."</p>
<p>By its guidelines for derogatory and offensive content, YouTube may prohibit advertisements from appearing on a video that "promotes discrimination, slanders or insults one or more groups of individuals." Aciman noted this includes slandering of people belonging to the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>Additionally, Aciman said that this policy could also include enforcing videos that "may contain deliberate death-naming or misgendering of transgender people."</p>
<p>In the past, YouTube has stated that misgendering isn't an element of its guidelines for community members that define what types of videos are allowed and cannot be completely removed. However, Aciman's declaration makes it clear that misgendering plays a significant role in the company's decision to monetize content.</p>
<p>The misgendering of people could be employed as a way to bully transgender people and that's just one of the lines of conflict which have emerged in the ongoing culture war that conservatives such as Owens are fighting in the direction of members of the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>Owens informed viewers on Monday that there could be videos gone missing since Friday however she didn't mention the channel that the videos were taken off of or the amount of videos removed.</p>
<p>Despite her assertions that YouTube was censoring her content and that they were censoring them, several videos where she debates trans rights, as well as gender identity, remain among more than 1,200 videos available on the podcast YouTube channel, which has 1.67 million users. Yes, on Wednesday, the channel posted these films with the hashtags #pronouns, #trans, and #transgender.</p>
<p><em><strong>More: </strong></em><a title="What are the readily available YouTube alternatives" href="../top-news/readily-available-youtube-alternatives"><em><strong>What are the readily available YouTube alternatives</strong></em></a></p>
<p>In the film released on August 20, 2021, via YouTube that showed Owens addressed an activist for trans rights Serena Daniari, she said that the "trans movement is a satire of what it is to be an individual woman." The video published in April 2022 shows Owens reacting to gender-neutral pronouns. In an additional episode released at the same time, Owens claimed that a mom of a transgender child "mutilated the once healthy and growing son because of an uneasy feeling he experienced."</p>
<p>A video where Owens selects an unidentified child uploaded on YouTube at the end of May in advance of the start of Pride Month in June is still online. In the episode aired on May 31, Owens referred to the gender of Rachelle Lechevre's daughter by calling it "nonexistent."</p>
<p>YouTube's policy on harassment states it is protected from "harmful behavior such as inflicting insults or shame on minors and intimidation, threatening or promoting aggressive fan behavior" YouTube wrote in its guidelines for community members. YouTube can remove any content that violates its guidelines regarding hate speech and harassment.</p>
<p>"All creators must adhere to Our Community Guidelines, which prohibit content that promotes hatred towards protected groups, which includes members of the LGBTQ+ community," Aciman declared in her statement.</p>
<p>Concerning YouTube's recent actions against her content Owens claimed that YouTube has thwarted her ability to express truth "truth." Owens maintains an active stance against the elements of the movement for transgender equality as well as aspects that are part of her <strong><a title="LGBTQ group on social platforms" href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/online-communities-and-lgbtq-youth">LGBTQ group on social platforms</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In recent months, Owens and the conservative outlet she's associated with The Daily Wire, have been at the forefront of several controversies surrounding their statements about transgender people and how social media platforms treat them.</p>
<p>In her YouTube video, Owens discusses her treatment at YouTube, Owens also accused the site of snaring Matt Walsh's channel following the film's release "What is a Woman?" starring Walsh. The documentary that was anti-trans garnered the endorsement of Twitter founder Elon Musk. The latter tweeted "Every parent should see this" in an online post on Twitter on the 2nd of June. Twitter initially blocked the publication of the film on its platform, which Musk did not change, leading to the public departure last week of the head of safety and trust, Ella Irwin.</p>
<p>Musk removed Twitter's ban on users from sexism through the site in April. This was an action that was heavily condemned by LGBTQ advocacy organizations.</p>
<p>Owens stated that <strong>YouTube removed the monetization of Walsh's channel</strong>, and now was focused on her and co-host Daily Wire host Michael Knowles and Michael Knowles' respective channels. "I believe it's because (Walsh) got targeted because he's been making a statement about gender concerns," Owens said on her podcast.</p>5f:T1762,<p>The European Union slapped Meta with an unprecedented $1.3 billion fine for privacy on Monday and demanded that it stop transferring the personal information of its users across the Atlantic in October. This is the latest blow in the long-running case that was sparked by U.S. cyber snooping fears.</p>
<p>Since the strict <strong><a title="data privacy regulations" href="../feature/databench-automating-data-mapping-privacy-compliance-for-modern-business">data privacy regulations</a></strong> of the EU went into force five years ago, the punishment of 1.2 million euros was the highest. This is higher than Amazon's $746 million euros penalty in 2021 over data protection breaches.</p>
<p>Meta The business, which has previously expressed concern that it would lose access to its European consumers, has vowed to appeal and ask judges to render their ruling as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Facebook has stated that "there are no imminent interruptions for Facebook for Europe." This decision is applicable to data of users such as names, email addresses, and IP addresses, as well as messages and view history, geolocation information, and other data that Meta and other <strong><a title="tech giants" href="../top-news/apple-google-microsoft-passwordless-authentication">tech giants</a></strong> such as Google employ to deliver specific online ads.</p>
<p>According to Jennifer Newstead, president of global affairs and senior attorney at Nick Clegg Meta, "This decision is a mistake in its reasoning, is unjustified, and unintentionally creates a precedent for numerous other companies that transfer data between the EU and the USA"</p>
<p>It's a new twist in a court dispute that started in 2013 when Austrian lawyer and activist for privacy Max Schrems filed a complaint concerning Facebook's handling of his personal data in the wake of the former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations of electronic surveillance conducted by U.S. security agencies. The revelations included that Facebook allowed security agencies access to the personal information of Europeans.</p>
<p>The scandal has brought to light the tensions between Washington as well as Brussels regarding the differences between Europe's rigorous policy on data privacy versus the relatively loose regulations of the U.S., which lacks a federal privacy law. With a set of regulations requiring them to more closely control their platforms and protect the privacy of their users' data, the EU has been a global pioneer in curtailing the dominance that is Big Tech.</p>
<p>An agreement that governs EU-U.S. data transfer known by the name of Privacy Shield, was ruled invalid at the end of the 2020 year in the European Union's highest court, which ruled that it wasn't enough to shield citizens against the U.S. government's electronic prying. The court's ruling on Monday confirmed that a different method to regulate the transfer of data - legal stock contracts also was invalid.</p>
<p>Brussels as well as Washington signed a deal in the year 2000 on the reformed Privacy Shield, which Meta could utilize, but the pact awaits an answer from European officials regarding how well it will protect privacy of data.</p>
<p>EU institutions have been examining the agreement and the EU's lawmakers have demanded improvements, claiming the security provisions aren't sufficient.</p>
<p><strong><a title="Dublin's Data Protection Commission" href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/">Dublin's Data Protection Commission</a></strong> handed down the fine as Meta's leading privacy regulator within the bloc of 27 nations because the Silicon Valley tech giant's European headquarters is located in Dublin.</p>
<p>The Irish watchdog said it granted Meta the time to cease transmitting European user's data to U.S. users. U.S. as well as six months for bringing its data processing operations in line with the law "by ending the illegal processing, and even storage within the U.S." of European users' personal information transfer in violation of Privacy rules of the bloc.</p>
<p>If the transatlantic privacy agreement is implemented before these deadlines, "our services can continue exactly as they are today, without interruption or impact on our users," Meta said.</p>
<p>Schrems declared that Meta is "no likely chance" of getting the ruling in any way overturned. A new privacy pact may not be the end of the problems for Meta, as there's a chance that it'll be rejected by the top court of the EU according to him.</p>
<p>"Meta intends to use the new arrangement to transfer data in the future but this is probably not a permanent solution," Schrems said in an announcement. "Unless U.S. surveillance laws are changed, Meta will likely have to maintain EU information in Europe. EU."</p>
<p>Meta was warned in its most recent earnings report that, without an appropriate legal framework for data transfer it could be forced to discontinue offering its services and products across Europe, "which would have a materially negative impact on the financial health of our company and the operational performance."</p>
<p>The company that runs social media may need to undertake a complex and costly overhaul of its processes if ordered to stop transferring information about users through the Atlantic. According to its website, Meta has a fleet of 21 <strong><a title="data centers" href="../technology/storage/38/The-Beginner%E2%80%99s-Guide-to-Understanding-Cloud-Computing">data centers</a></strong>, but most of them are situated in the United States. Three more are situated in the European countries comprising Denmark, Ireland, and Sweden. The third is in Singapore.</p>
<p>Other giants of social media are being scrutinized for their privacy practices. TikTok has attempted to calm Western concerns about the Chinese-owned video-sharing application's possible security risks by launching the announcement of a $1.5 billion plan to keep U.S. user data on Oracle servers.</p>60:T5583,<p>A new report of research by Berg Insight, the IoT company of analysts Berg Insight reveals that the use of smart meters for electricity across Latin America * was 6.2 percent by 2022.</p>
<p>The amount of smart meters is expected to expand at a staggering average annual percentage of 21.7 percent from 2022 to 2028. It will achieve a total of 38.4 million units by the close of the forecast time which is an increase from 11.7 million units by 2022.</p>

<p>The market for smart meters across Latin America is becoming more attractive to a range of smart meter providers and a variety of utilities in regions are increasing investment into AMI infrastructure. In the six years ahead the rate of penetration for smart meters within Latin America's&nbsp;largest market Brazil will grow from 5.7 percent in 2022 and 21.5 percent by 2028. Brazil as well as Mexico will be responsible for more than 80 percent of all smart meter sales during the period forecast.</p>
<p><strong>IoT Analyst Mattias Carlsson from Berg Insight Said</strong></p>
<p>"Latin America will see a rise in the number of meters being installed in the coming years due to both the extension of current smart meters and brand-new important projects. Apart from the two major markets of Brazil and Mexico as well as countries such as Colombia as well as Peru will increase their share of annual shipping volumes from about four percent by 2022 and more than 16 percent by 2028. Colombia is expected to boost annual volumes of shipping 10 times over, whereas Peru will grow the volume of its annual shipping 16 times over the forecast timeframe ."</p>

<p>According to a newly published study, annual shipments of <strong><a title="smart electric meters" href="https://taraenergy.com/blog/what-is-a-smart-meter/">smart electric meters</a></strong> across Latin America will grow from 1.9 million devices in 2022 to nearly 6.1 million by 2028. This is what makes Latin America one of the most rapidly growing markets for smart meters globally.</p>
<p>The most common applications that are used in Latin America include remote meter reading and fault detection, distribution automation, and assessing the quality of power.</p>
<p>He said. Carlsson concluded: "As Latin <a title="America" href="../startup-insights/wall-street-six-banks-earn-1-trillion-in-decade"><strong>America</strong></a> is poised for significant growth in the upcoming years, the competition has started between the best meters to capture market share within the region. So far, Chinese smart meter vendors have seen significant success across Latin America. The main reason for this is their capability to provide price competition, which is a key factor for price-sensitive companies which operate within the area."</p>
<p>*<strong>Latin America</strong> is defined as the South American countries Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay and also the Central American countries Costa Rica, Mexico, and Panama</p>61:Td49,<p>It appears that complaining could be successful, considering that Microsoft has made a change regarding the cramming of one of the most popular Windows 11 applications with advertisements.</p>
<p>As <strong><a title="Windows latest reports" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/05/14/microsoft-succumbs-to-public-outrage-removes-some-ads-from-windows-11-weather-app/">Windows latest reports</a> </strong>(opens in a new window), Microsoft had recently modified the Weather app on Windows 11 to be based on the MSN website's weather services. While this shouldn't have been controversial, considering that web-based applications can use less space on the disk and run faster than traditional Windows applications, Microsoft still found a way to annoy users by inserting ads into what was previously an ad-free app.</p>
<p>This isn't the only time Microsoft has upset customers by integrating advertisements into its products and services, but it seems like this time, it went a bit far and caused a backlash via social media and Microsoft's feedback platform which led the company to remove ads from its app, or at most in a few of the apps.</p>
<p>The home screen will no longer be able to see advertisements within the app. However the Windows Latest discovered and I've verified, when you go to a different page in the app like 'Forecasts' for instance there are still advertisements.</p>
<p>If you select 'See the full forecast' in the widget for Weather, you'll land on the MSN weather site that also displays advertisements. This also opens within the Microsoft Edge web browser. However, If you don't have it set as your default browser and you're not set, you'll get an alert soliciting you to change this.</p>

<h2><strong>A Welcomed U-turn, Still It's Not Enough</strong></h2>
<p>The constant stream of ads and annoying pop-ups can cause Windows 11 to feel like work to use, and I'm happy that Microsoft appears to have heard some of these complaints.</p>
<p>An organization that listens to its customers' feedback and makes changes that are relevant is always a good thing and should be praised. However, though I would love for this to be a signal that Microsoft is reviewing its entire strategy for advertising on Windows 11, unfortunately, I'm not convinced it is.</p>
<p>The reality that Microsoft had to remove ads from the homepage in the Weather app, without acknowledging it suggests that Microsoft isn't a huge fan of this decision and may reinstate ads in the same way as it did when it took them off.</p>
<p>Additionally, the fact that ads are only being removed from a single screen in a single app, makes me think that this is an action that is unlikely to be replicated elsewhere, or even. It's a little like Microsoft has reluctantly eliminated only the minimum amount of advertisements.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though this is an excellent move, <a title="Microsoft" href="../software/microsoft-unveils-loop-in-public-preview"><strong>Microsoft</strong></a> has a lot more to accomplish in order to respond to the concerns people are having about the freedoms it's allowing users when it comes to Windows 11.</p>62:Tb25,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google says Gmail is introducing a new way or a new feature that will verify the legitimacy of a sender and it will be a blue checkmark next to the name of the organization.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>How Can You Tell If The Organization Emailing You Is Who It Claims To Be?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google says Gmail is introducing a new way or a new feature that will verify the legitimacy of a sender and it will be a blue checkmark next to the name of the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google LLC is a multinational technology organization engaged in online advertising, cloud computing, search engine technology, computer software, e-commerce, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and consumer electronics. Gmail is a free emailing service of Google that is used by billions of users across the world and Google put a notional thought behind the introduction of the new feature in Gmail- blue checkmark.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Why Does This New Feature Matter?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This new feature of Gmail will tell phishing attempts and impersonators from missives from the real McCoy.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google said, &ldquo;We introduced the verified checkmark as yet another layer of protection against malicious and unwanted emails. Seeing the checkmark should give users increased confidence that their email is from a legitimate source. Thousands of companies have already adopted this open verification standard, and we expect many more to join in the coming days&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google said these blue checkmarks are not accessible to everyone, only those organizations that adopt the <strong><a title="BIMI" href="https://bimigroup.org/">BIMI</a></strong> (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) security system supported by Google since 2021 have them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier, if an organization used Brand Indicators for Message Identification security system and authenticated with Google, Gmail would show its logo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that a blue checkmark displays beside the organization&rsquo;s name. As of now, organizations like <strong><a title="Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></strong> and Apple are using the Gmail checkmark.</span></p>63:T9f6,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Google, the tech child of Alphabet Inc said on Friday that it will update Bard. Bard is the chatbot of Google powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that helps developers write code for creating software.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since ChatGPT arrived, there has been an unstoppable war between tech companies about their own version. After OpenAI, Microsoft added that feature to its Bing search engine, and now Google has entered this war zone with its tool named Bard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google, the tech child of Alphabet Inc said on Friday that it will update Bard. Bard is the chatbot of Google powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that helps developers write code for creating software. Bard is the clear intention of Google playing catch-up in a fast-moving race on AI technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In March, Google started unveiling Bard to the public to gain ground on Microsoft Corp. When OpenAI, a startup backed by Microsoft released <strong><a title="ChatGPT" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a></strong> last year caused a new storm in the technology sector to put AI into more users&rsquo; hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google defines Bard as an experiment in the tech world enabling collaboration with generative AI. Generative artificial intelligence is a technology that relies on past data to create instead of identifying content.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bard will be able to write code in 20 different <strong><a title="programming languages" href="https://www.simplilearn.com/best-programming-languages-start-learning-today-article">programming languages</a></strong> like C++, Python, and Java, and can detect bugs and explain code to users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alphabet Inc&rsquo;s Google said Bard has also been created in a way to optimize code to make it faster or more efficacious with simple prompts like &ldquo;Could you make that code faster?&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, A small set of users can only access Bard and can chat with the bot and ask questions rather than using Google's traditional search tool. </span></p>64:Tb46,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data breachers then entered the account to create substantial data backups that were then downloaded and deleted.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodi, the open-source media player which has been spawned from the love of media, has come with a sensational revealing of data breaching. The company has confirmed that hackers have breached its data and stolen the MyBB forum database of the company which includes data and private messages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the hackers attempted to sell the database that includes 400,635 users on the now-defunct BreachForums cybercrime marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data breachers then entered the account to create substantial data backups that were then downloaded and deleted. Also downloaded data were existing complete backups of the database. The account has been disabled since then.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodi said in an advisory, "MyBB admin logs show the account of a trusted but currently inactive member of the forum admin team was used to access the web-based <a title="MyBB" href="https://mybb.com/"><strong>MyBB</strong></a> admin console twice: on 16 February and again on 21 February,".</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downloaded nightly backups have team forum posts, all public forum posts, user information like forum usernames, email addresses, and an encrypted (hashed and salted) password produced by the MyBB software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kodi stated the company has not found any evidence of hackers getting unauthorized access to the underlying server. The company further emphasized that the legal account owner did not make malicious actions on the admin console, suggesting credential theft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order of caution, the team from Kodi said that work is in progress to initiate a global password reset. Users are suggested to change their passwords on other websites if they are using the same password everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taking extra security precautions, <a title="Kodi" href="https://kodi.tv/"><strong>Kodi</strong></a> is tightening access to the MyBB admin console, revising admin roles to limit privileges, and enhancing audit logging and backup procedures.</span></p>65:Tacb,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The root cause of the vulnerability arises from what&rsquo;s called "Shared Responsibility confusion," wherein an Azure app can be inappropriately configured to enable users from any Microsoft tenant, leading to a potential case of unintended access.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft has rectified a misconfiguration loophole that was affecting the Azure Active Directory (AAD) identity and access management service that brought down multiple &ldquo;high-impact&rdquo; applications to unauthorized access.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cloud security firm, Wiz, said, "One of these apps is a content management system (CMS) that powers Bing.com and allowed us to not only modify search results but also launch high-impact XSS attacks on Bing users. Those attacks could compromise users' personal data, including Outlook emails and SharePoint documents."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wiz reported these vulnerabilities to Microsoft in January and February 2022 and received a prize of $40, 000 from the tech giant. <strong><a title="Microsoft" href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a></strong> fixed these issues subsequently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The root cause of the vulnerability arises from what&rsquo;s called "Shared Responsibility confusion," wherein an Azure app can be inappropriately configured to enable users from any Microsoft tenant, leading to a potential case of unintended access.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly a couple of internal apps by Microsoft were seen showing this behavior, thereby permitting external parties to get read and write to the impacted applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of those apps is the Bing Trivia app, which the cybersecurity firm exploited to impact search results in Bing and even control the content on the homepage as part of a cyber attack chain dubbed BingBang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create worst situations, the exploit could be armored to accelerate a <strong><a title="cross-site scripting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a></strong> (XSS) attack on Bing.com and draw out a victim&rsquo;s Outlook emails, Team messages, calendars, SharePoint documents, and OneDrive files.</span></p>66:Tb90,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Opti9 Technologies, a hybrid cloud solutions provider with a focus on security, cloud, and application modernization has come up with Observr Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ransomware detection and standalone managed services.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opti9 Technologies, a hybrid cloud solutions provider with a focus on security, cloud, and application modernization has come up with Observr Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) ransomware detection and standalone managed services. It includes two new discrete service offerings that cater to organizations leveraging Veeam Software.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the difficulties of the IT division of organizations continue to evolve, the technical teams are extremely interested in shifting ownership to third-party service providers for critical layers of their stack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is especially applicable for backup and disaster recovery components, which must provide flexibility even after constant changes like the shift to hybrid clouds and SaaS, the use of software-defined networking, application modernization, and the extreme risks coupled with ransomware and data theft.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Danny Allan, CTO at Veeam, said, &ldquo;Opti9 has leveraged <a title="Veeam" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veeam"><strong>Veeam</strong></a>&rsquo;s feature-rich API in an innovative and unique way to address the very real security challenges being faced by IT organizations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observr by Opti9 allows Veeam customers to further strengthen their security posture and ensure their backup and disaster recovery infrastructure is protected via the use of Observr&rsquo;s AI-based anomaly detection. Additionally, the SLA-backed threat detection service, and its integrations with security platforms such as SIEMs and XDR software, provide increased assurances from a trusted Veeam partner&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To address these requirements, many companies move to managed services providers for managing backups or <strong><a title="Disaster Recovery-As-A-Service" href="https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/disaster-recovery-service-draas.html">Disaster Recovery-As-A-Service</a></strong> (BaaS/DRaaS). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the isolated nature and the rigidity of most offerings do not address the risks faced today. Companies are looking to decouple critical security monitoring from infrastructure services and value-added managed services.</span></p>67:Tb14,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Loop was first introduced at ignite in 2021 and has been in testing since then.

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wangui McKelvey, General Manager for Apps and Endpoints at Microsoft, said, &ldquo;Now, in our current landscape, we encounter more ambiguity and uncertainty than ever, requiring us to co-create in fast-paced and dynamic environments. We need tools that embrace the messiness of our creative process and can adapt to our ever-evolving needs,&rdquo;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The loop includes three major elements: Loop components, Loop pages, and Loop workspaces. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loop components are portable content pieces that can include tables, lists, and notes which are supported in <a title="Outlook" href="https://outlook.live.com/"><strong>Outlook</strong></a>, Teams, and Whiteboard and are soon to be unveiled for Word for the web.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Loop pages are shared, and flexible canvases where users can organize their Loop components and pull in elements like files, links, or data while Loop workspaces work as shared platforms where users can view and assemble the important elements of their projects together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These four vulnerabilities enable Internet-to-baseband remote code execution, which means that a hacker can remotely challenge a device at the baseband level without involving the user.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These vulnerabilities impact a broad array of devices, including Samsung Vivo mobiles, wearables that use the Exynos W920 chipset, and vehicles using the <a title="Exynos Auto T5123 chipset" href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/processor/automotive-processor/exynos-auto-t5123/"><strong>Exynos Auto T5123 chipset</strong></a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While patch timelines are expected to vary by manufacturer, users can save themselves from the vulnerabilities of the baseband remote code execution by switching off Wi-Fi calling and VoLTE in their device settings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">End-users are also motivated to update their devices at the earliest to ascertain that they are running the latest issues that fix undisclosed and disclosed security vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Delaying Disclosures</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Project Zero of Google has taken the decision to delay the disclosure of the four most dangerous vulnerabilities due to the potential for attackers to benefit more than defenders if vulnerabilities have to be disclosed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The remaining fourteen <a title="vulnerabilities" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/"><strong>vulnerabilities</strong></a> will be publicly disclosed if they are not fixed even after 90 days.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">eSentire, the cybersecurity firm says, malicious ads are employed to trick a wide array of legitimate apps and services like Spotify, Zoom, Tableau, Adobe, and OpenAPI's ChatGPT.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the name says, BATLOADER is a loader that distributes next-level malware like banking malware, information stealers, Cobalt Strike, and even ransomware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the significant features of malware is the use of software impersonation tricks for malware delivery.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">eSentire said, "BATLOADER continues to see changes and improvement since it first emerged in 2022. BATLOADER targets various popular applications for impersonation. This is no accident, as these applications are commonly found in business networks and thus, they would yield more valuable footholds for monetization via fraud or hands-on-keyboard intrusions."</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatsapp, the chat platform owned by Meta (Previously Facebook) has said if the upcoming Online Safety Bill tries to force the company to weaken its end-to-end encryption for users, it will leave the UK market right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an announcement, Will Cathcart, Whatsapp Head slammed the UK legislation as the most concerning set of online regulations in the western part of the globe.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Also Read, <a title="WhatsApp Now Allows Users to Send 100 Photos and Videos" href="../software/whatsapp-allows-users-send-100-photos-videos">WhatsApp Now Allows Users to Send 100 Photos and Videos</a></strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will Cathcart, Whatsapp Head, said, We've recently been blocked in Iran, for example. But we've never seen a liberal democracy do that. Ninety-eight percent of our users are outside the UK. It would be an odd choice for us to choose to lower the security of the product in a way that would affect those 98 percent of users.``</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="WhatsApp" href="https://www.whatsapp.com/"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></a>'s Head said he is worried that the upcoming bill and regulations make it tough for Whatsapp and other messaging platforms to provide end-to-end protection using encryption technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>What does the Upcoming Bill Say?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A provision in the new Online Safety Bill needs tech firms to use &ldquo;Accredited Technology&rdquo; for scanning the chats and messages and monitor child sexual abuse material or CSAM.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security experts executing such regulation for accredited technology will be impossible without breaking <a title="end-to-end encryption" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption"><strong>end-to-end encryption</strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Online Safety Bill also puts liability of giant tech companies and firms that fail to fall in with new rules could have to pay 18 million pounds as a fine or 10% of their annual global turnover, whichever is highest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new provision would include more strict and quicker criminal sanctions for tech firms and new criminal offenses if they falsify and destroy such data.</span></p>6b:T8c5,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;</span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company reveals Whisper large-v2, the open source model will deliver &ldquo;faster and cost-effective results,&rdquo; through the API whereas the ChatGPT model will keep evolving.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In an announcement, OpenAI said, developers who are interested in using chatbot ChatGPT powered by artificial intelligence and Whisper- the speech-to-text model can do it through API provided by maker OpenAI.</span></p>

<p>Cybersecurity is a critical part of doing business in the digital age. By understanding what it is and how it works, businesses can protect themselves from the many cyber threats they face every day.</p>74:Tc3c,<p>The phrase "Internet of Things" (IoT) refers to the increasingly complex ecosystems of online, interconnected objects that populate our planet. The relatively peculiar term alludes to the reality that the original internet was nothing more than a network of interconnected computers. Phones, office supplies including printers and scanners, and commercial machines were all added to the internet as it expanded. The internet of "things" is a result of the fact that nearly any gadget we use today&mdash;in our homes, workplaces, factories, or even just as something we wear on our bodies&mdash;can be online and connected.</p>
<h3>IoT Trends 2022&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>1. Improvements in healthcare</strong></p>
<p>For the past two years, the COVID19 pandemic and its ever-evolving forms, such as Delta and Omicron, have presented a challenge for the entire world. Everyone is focused on healthcare, which has emerged as one of the main sectors for IoT development. Specialized medical devices including insulin pumps, oxygen concentrators, blood pressure monitors, heart rate monitors, and wheelchairs are all linked to the cloud to assist in data collection so doctors may better understand the needs of their patients.</p>
<p><strong>2. Edge Computing</strong></p>
<p>Together, IoT and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/edge-computing"><strong>edge computing</strong></a> can create devices with built-in analytics capabilities, enabling processing to take place near to the data source. This works really well for cloud computing and multi-cloud Kubernetes management, which use sensors to gather data and then send it to the cloud for analysis.</p>
<p>Edge gadgets rely on intelligent sensors like computer vision-capable cameras and microphones with natural language processing capabilities. Rapid computation reduces the amount of data transferred back and forth between clouds, hence reducing network congestion.</p>
<p>The privacy concerns of the pervasive IoT are another journey. Users may be certain that when a device captures personal data, they can access the insights without divulging personal information.</p>
<p><strong>3. IoT in Business and Industry</strong></p>
<p>The Internet of Things, sometimes known as the "industrial internet," has significant effects on how we produce goods, deliver services, sell to clients, and give customer support. The automation of smart factories and logistics facilities is accelerating, and in 2022, more and more smaller businesses will start to take advantage of the opportunities this presents thanks to the availability of robotics and IoT infrastructure "as-a-service." Businesses can gain from enhanced efficiency by incorporating<a href="https://iotautomation.com.au/"><strong> IoT automation</strong></a> into their business models, which allows them to obtain a data-driven insight of their operations and procedures. Following the extraordinary disruption of the previous two years, resilience is a top priority, and IoT technology offers excellent opportunity to create businesses that are more resilient to disasters.</p>75:T857,<p>Platform engineering is the science of creating toolchains and workflows that give software engineering organisations self-service capabilities in the cloud-native era. Platform engineers offer an integrated product, most frequently known as a "internal developer platform," that addresses all operational requirements over the course of an application's lifespan.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of platform engineering</strong></p>
<p>Let's take a step back to examine the <strong><a href="https://blog.systems-x.com/technology-challenges-businesses-face">types of difficulties a tech company</a></strong> confronts when it comes to the deployment and operation of software in order to comprehend why platform engineering important.</p>
<p>In a word, more mature, more established businesses are beginning to see the enormous potential advantages of cloud computing. However, they need the required knowledge of the cloud, infrastructure as code, containers, container orchestration, and more in order to take use of those advantages.</p>
<p>As a result, several of these companies are beginning to establish platform engineering teams. Such teams' primary duty is to guarantee the quick delivery of software to production.</p>
<p><strong>But what actually happen with these teams?</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">What Does an Engineering Team for a Platform Do? </span>"Developer enablers" or "enablement teams" are two more excellent names for platform engineering teams. To put it briefly, they develop and maintain a set of tools and processes that enable engineers to deliver code to production in a dependable and effective manner.</p>
<p>Another way to put it is that platform engineering teams serve as an abstraction layer between IT infrastructure and engineers. Developers can thus concentrate on creating and releasing useful features rather than worrying about the infrastructure's inner workings.</p>
<p>Platform engineers employ automation to make their knowledge and experience available to the company, to put it in more concrete terms. Usually, this takes the form of web portals or APIs.</p>76:T87d,<p>Through cyber-physical systems, the effects that the digital world can now have on the real world are more noticeable than ever. Organizations should be aware of this because it could give cyber threat actors new ways to compromise someone's physical safety. The internet of things (IoT) expansion and evolution, as well as a shift toward more software-centric and intrinsically internet- and cloud-reliant technologies, are largely to blame for the quick development of cyber-physical systems.</p>
<p>IoT refers to the countless numbers of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Physical_objects#:~:text=In%20physics%2C%20a%20physical%20body,particles%20(pieces%20of%20matter)."><strong>physical objects</strong></a> that link to one another and share information online. These gadgets could be as commonplace as the smart watch we wear, complex like the cars we drive, or vital like the medical equipment that keeps us alive. IoT that is software-centric fosters innovation and introduces new features more quickly, but it also significantly increases the attack surface. The effects of this become more significant as IoT devices' influence on our physical world grows. Over the past 30 years or so, attacks on IT have changed and advanced.</p>
<p>Why is protecting SDVs crucial? The answer is that cybersecurity will play a big role in vehicle safety in next-generation automobiles. In 2019, distracted driving was a factor in 6% of fatal crashes and 8% of crashes that resulted in injuries in the United States. Think about what may occur if a threat actor managed to distract the driver by compromising the infotainment system in a car. What may a seemingly innocuous loud noise from the car speakers possibly do? This is more than just speculation. A significant vulnerability in a SiriusXM connected vehicle (CV) service that impacts millions of vehicles was found by cybersecurity researchers.</p>

<p><strong>5G networks</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest stories in the tech industry this year has been the continued expansion of 5G networks. This next-generation wireless technology has already begun rolling out in many countries around the world, and it is expected to revolutionize the way we connect to the internet. With speeds that are up to 100 times faster than 4G, 5G will enable new applications and services that were previously not possible, such as remote medical procedures, self-driving cars, and virtual reality experiences.</p>
<p><strong>AI</strong></p>
<p>Another area of technology that has garnered a lot of attention recently is artificial intelligence (AI). There have been significant advances in the field of AI over the past few years, and it is beginning to be integrated into a wide range of products and services. Companies in various industries are using AI to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the customer experience. For example, AI is being used to optimize supply chain management, personalize online recommendations, and improve the accuracy of financial forecasts.</p>
<p>In the realm of personal technology, one of the biggest trends this year has been the rise of foldable smartphones. These devices have flexible screens that allow them to be folded in half, making them more portable and convenient to use. In addition to their unique form factor, foldable smartphones also offer a larger screen size when unfolded, making them ideal for multitasking and media consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong></p>
<p>Another trend that has been gaining momentum in the tech world is the Internet of Things (IoT). This refers to the growing network of connected devices that are able to communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet. There are already billions of IoT devices in use today, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. The IoT has the potential to transform industries such as agriculture, transportation, and healthcare by allowing for the automation and optimization of processes.</p>
<p>In summary, 6 January 2023 has seen a number of exciting developments in the world of technology. From the continued rollout of 5G networks to the rise of AI and IoT, there are many innovations that are poised to shape the future.</p>78:T89a,<p>On Thursday Twitter suspended the accounts of several prominent journalists who recently wrote about its new owner Elon Musk, with the billionaire tweeting that rules banning the publishing of personal information applied to all, including journalists.</p>
<p>Responding to a Tweet on the account suspensions, Musk, who has portrayed himself as a free speech absolutist, tweeted: "Same doxxing rules apply to 'journalists' as to everyone else," a reference to Twitter rules banning the sharing of personal information, called doxxing.</p>
<p>According to Deccan Chronicle, "Musk's tweet referred to Twitter's Wednesday suspension of @elonjet, an account tracking his private jet in real time using data available in the public domain. Musk had threatened legal action against the account's operator, saying his son had been mistakenly followed by a "crazy stalker".</p>
<p>It was unclear if all the journalists whose accounts were suspended had commented on or shared news about @elonjet."</p>
<p>Reuters said, "The suspensions echo chaotic actions at Twitter since Musk took over, including rapid firings of top management and thousands of employees, seesawing on how much to charge for Twitter's subscription service Twitter Blue, and reinstating banned accounts, including that of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Twitter now leans heavily on automation to moderate content, doing away with certain manual reviews and favoring restrictions on distribution rather than removing certain speech outright, its new head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, told Reuters this month."</p>
<p>They also said, "Among the journalist accounts suspended on Thursday was that of Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell (@drewharwell), who wrote on social media platform Mastodon that he had recently written about Musk and posted links to "publicly available, legally acquired data."</p>
<p>Twitter also suspended the official account of Mastodon (@joinmastodon), which has emerged as an alternative to Twitter. Mastodon could not immediately be reached for comment."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Last of Us Part 1</h2>
<p>About part one of this game Engadget said, "Part I is a modern remake of the original The Last of Us, Naughty Dog's dramatic zombie-adjacent game that came out in 2013 and quickly became an industry darling. There's since been a sequel, an upgraded version of that game, a remastered version of the original title for PS4, and probably a few other iterations we're forgetting, plus an HBO series coming out in January.</p>
<p>We found The Last of Us Part I on PS5 to be gorgeous yet achingly faithful to its source material. For fans of the series, that's not a terrible outcome, and soon PC players will have the chance to judge for themselves."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vampire Survivors</h2>
<p>Steam Powered said, "Vampire Survivors is a time survival game with minimalistic gameplay and roguelite elements.</p>
<p>Hell is empty, the devils are here, and there's no place to run or hide. All you can do is survive as long as you can until death inevitably puts an end to your struggles. Gather gold in each run to buy upgrades and help the next survivor.</p>
<p>The supernatural indie phenomenon that lets you be the bullet hell!</p>
<p>Supports mouse, keyboard, controller, and touch screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Starting Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take your time to grab gems and items, they won't disappear.</li>
<li>Get two or three offensive weapons at first, but focus on leveling them up one at a time.</li>
<li>Armour and Luck are good starting power-ups to spend money on.</li>
<li>Refund power-ups often, it's free, and try new upgrade paths."</li>
</ul>

<p>For more updates on IOT, <a href="../technology/iot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.&nbsp;</p>7a:Tb27,<p>In a piece of recent news, <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/"><strong>IBM </strong></a>and the Canadian Government have chosen Quebec to house its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ib-ms-first-retail-quantum-computer-is-headed-to-the-cleveland-clinic-100152978.html"><strong>first universal quantum system</strong></a> in Canada and the fourth one deployed outside of the US.</p>
<p>IBM announced its partnership with the Canadian government for deployment on 3 Feb 2022. The company further announced that Canada&rsquo;s first universal quantum computer will be deployed at the IBM Bromont plant in Bromont, Quebec. <em>Quantum computing is rare&mdash;which makes installing a system within a country a massive breakthrough.</em> Moreover, IBM is leveraging the advantage of novelty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Breakthrough Novelty</h2>
<p>IBM has forged a <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/22/02/03/2025204/canada-will-get-its-first-universal-quantum-computer-from-ibm">five-year deal partnership</a> with the Canadian government, under which IBM will install a Quantum System One as part of a Quebec-IBM Discovery Accelerator project tackling scientific and commercial challenges. The company, along with the Quebec government, will foster microelectronics work. It will also include progress in chip packaging with the help of an existing IBM facility in the province.</p>
<p>In addition, IBM and the government organization also plan to show how quantum and classical computers can work together to address scientific challenges and expect quantum-powered AI to help discover new medicines and materials. The IBM Quantum System One will help researchers develop new solutions in sectors such as energy, life sciences, and sustainability, as well as to improve quantum computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Revolutionizing the Scientific Community</h2>
<p>IBM did not further comment on the installation program, as to how it will install the quantum computer. It will be the fifth Quantum One installation planned by 2023 following similar partnerships in Germany, Japan, South Korea and the US. Canada is joining a relatively exclusive club, then.</p>
<p>Canada is no stranger to quantum computing. D-Wave, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-06-20-d-wave-quantum-computer-test-results.html">company which sparked major controversies</a> in the past, is based in Canada itself. However, the IBM move is significant as it gives Canada a more generalized system that could conquer problems impractical to solve using conventional supercomputers. This won't necessarily revolutionize Canada&rsquo;s scientific community, but it could provide an edge until quantum computing is relatively commonplace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>7b:T90b,<p><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LastPass</a> noticed some unusual activity within a third-party cloud storage service that is shared by LastPass and affiliate GoTo. According to Fox News, "CEO Karim Toubba said the company recently detected unusual activity within a third-party cloud storage service that is shared by LastPass and affiliate GoTo.</p>
<p>He said an investigation was immediately launched into the incident by security firm Mandiant and that law enforcement had been alerted."</p>
<p>They also said, "Password manager LastPass announced Wednesday it had suffered its second data breach in three months."</p>
<p>Mike Walters, VP of vulnerability and threat research at Action1, told Spiceworks. &ldquo;The trend of repeated hacks, where the company fails to eliminate the consequences of the breach for months, is frustrating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How to avoid data breaching</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walters said, &ldquo;To avoid this mistake, you should take decisive steps to investigate the security incident, as well as to find and fix any and all security vulnerabilities. Namely, carefully examine the investigation report and conduct an in-depth analysis of all architectural issues. Implement robust network segmentation and complete visibility into network traffic and user behavior. Ensure you receive alerts about any abnormal events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, validate that your IDS/IPS, Endpoint Protection, EDR, NGFW, Sandbox, Honeypot, and RMM systems are in place and fine-tuned according to your business needs.&nbsp; Finally, you need to have a SOC center for incident response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The company's response</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toubba said, "We are working diligently to understand the scope of the incident and identify what specific information has been accessed.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, we can confirm that LastPass products and services remain fully functional,&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to The Edge Markets, "The company recommended that its users "follow our best practices around setup and configuration", including setting up multi-factor authentication."</p>
<p>For more updates on security industry,&nbsp;<a href="../technology/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>7c:T790,<p>Google is expected to keep only secured app but "was found to have many apps with malware in them, infecting those users' gadgets who downloaded any of them. Recently, cyber security experts have found variants of the SharkBot malware in several file manager Android apps on the Google Play Store. Some of these apps have thousands of downloads and all these people now have infected phones.</p>
<p>A blog post by cyber security experts at Bitdefender informed that "the apps Bitdefender found are disguised as file managers, which explains why they request permission to install external packages from the users." Yes, that permission is used to download malware. These apps are even challenging to detect as all they need is the functionality of a file manager to install another app and the malicious behavior will be activated."&nbsp; published by Hindustan Times Tech.</p>
<p>They also said, "These apps have been taken down by Google from its Play Store. But still, these apps are widely circulating on some third-party websites, hence you need to be aware before downloading malware apps. Moreover, those who have already downloaded these dangerous apps, must delete them from their phones fast. How to identify them?</p>
<p>The first detected malware app was 'X-File Manager,' which was developed by 'Viktor Soft ICe LLC' and had around 10000 installs before its removal from the Play Store. Apart from this, the team also found 'FileVoyager', 'Phone AID, Cleaner, Booster', and 'LiteCleaner M'. Majority of the users who downloaded these malware apps were from the United Kingdom and Italy."</p>
<p>So it can be suggested that while downloading a software any users should see if it is a safe maker of software or not. This way they can take care of their phones and their data in it.</p>
<p>For more updates on security industry,&nbsp;<a href="../technology/security" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>7d:T722,<p>Apple has been in the news for some days because of the question over the security of personal data the company claims to provide. Recently it has been reported that iPhone's usage data is not anonymous which is not what the company promises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The data safety</h2>
<p>According to Gizmodo, "The privacy policy governing Apple&rsquo;s device analytics says the &ldquo;none of the collected information identifies you personally.&rdquo; But an analysis of the data sent to Apple shows it includes a permanent, unchangeable ID number called a Directory Services Identifier, or DSID, according to researchers from the software company Mysk. Apple collects that same ID number along with information for your Apple ID, which means the DSID is directly tied to your full name, phone number, birth date, email address and more, according to Mysk&rsquo;s tests."</p>
<p>According to Apple&rsquo;s analytics policy, &ldquo;Personal data is either not logged at all, is subject to privacy preserving techniques such as differential privacy, or is removed from any reports before they&rsquo;re sent to Apple.&rdquo; But Mysk&rsquo;s tests show that the DSID, which is directly tied to your name, is sent to Apple in the same packet as all the other analytics information.</p>
<p>While buying an Apple device a person opts for the company as the Apple gives guarantee for the person's data being safe and personnel. But this time, some tests proved that the truth is not the same as promised by the company. So here A question is raised: will people trust and buy Apple anymore or will they go for cheaper options where data safety is not something promised.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>7e:T8c6,<p>Microsoft's virtual keyboard application <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/swiftkey?activetab=pivot_1%3aprimaryr2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwiftKey</a> is unexpectedly back now on iOS&rsquo;s App Store.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> GSM Arena</a>, "A recent tweet by Microsoft's Vice President of Office Product Group confirms that SwiftKey is indeed back for Apple users and even teased new features in the future.</p>
<p>A company's spokesperson clarified that due to users' feedback, the tech giant is bringing back SwiftKey for iOS and it's renewing support for the platform. Moreover, Microsoft is going to invest heavily in SwiftKey in the future."</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ending support for Microsoft SwiftKey iOS. Thank you for being a user of our product. Please visit data.swiftkey.com for details on how to manage your data. The app will be delisted from the App Store on October 5th, 2022,&rdquo; the company said in an announcement earlier this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Other third-party applications on IOS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to The Indian Express, "And even though it is still unclear what Microsoft has in store, we expect the tech giant to improve the overall typing experience on Apple devices since there are not many good third-party apps available for the operating system. Indeed, SwiftKey is by far the best keyboard app out there, not only on iPhone but also on Android."</p>
<p>About this The Verge said, "Despite the return, SwiftKey&rsquo;s latest update is still from August 11th, 2021. It&rsquo;s unclear if or when it will be updated &mdash; users had complained about issues ahead of the discontinuation &mdash; but it seems like there will be some changes to look forward to. Vishnu Nath, Microsoft&rsquo;s VP and GM of OneNote and the Office product group, encouraged fans to &ldquo;stay tuned to what the team has in store.&rdquo; Pedram Rezaei, Microsoft&rsquo;s CTO of its maps and local services division, said that the company will be &ldquo;investing heavily in the keyboard.&rdquo;"</p>
<p>For more updates on storage industry, <a href="../technology/storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.</p>7f:T83c,<p>Many times it happens when you don't have pen and paper to jot down something. Even if you have them there is no guarantee that you will carry them with you and will be able to access them when needed. But you carry your phone all the time. There are so many ways you can jot down your ideas, reminders etc. But texting it on WhatsApp in a chat room looks to be the most convenient way. The best thing is that from now you'll be able to message yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About the new feature</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Android Police, "Late in October, we saw WhatsApp selectively beta testing a way to start a new conversation with yourself on the app. WABetaInfo now reports the feature is widely rolling out on iOS with version 22.23.74 of the app. We are also seeing it on many of our Android devices after updating WhatsApp to version 2.22.23.77.</p>
<p>It may not seem very useful at first, but messaging yourself could also be a great way to transfer small files between multiple smartphones wirelessly, now that WhatsApp is beta testing Companion Mode on Android. Things get even easier if you add a shortcut to the chat with yourself on your home screen.</p>
<p>You can just hit the floating action button (FAB) for a new WhatsApp message in the lower right-hand corner. The new option to message yourself should be pinned to the top of your list of contacts. Reassuringly, WhatsApp says this chat with yourself is also end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>However, the feature appears to be arriving on devices in a phased manner. So, it could take a few days to show up on your devices. Until then, you could always create a group with one other person, remove them, and use that space to chat with yourself. Perhaps you could still use this option to have two separate chats with yourself, for whatever reason."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>82:T1802,<p>In this blog, we will discuss the <a href="https://www.apple.com/in/macbook-air-m2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">M2 MacBook Air</a> in detail. Apple&rsquo;s bigwigs took to the stage at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2022 to unveil one of the largest overhauls of the MacBook Air in the device&rsquo;s decade-plus history. Everything went under the knife, from the external design to the chip it runs on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Price of M2 MacBook Air</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before WWDC, there were expectations that the MacBook Air would get a price bump. After all, that&rsquo;s what happened to the MacBook Pro when the 14-inch version launched. However, Apple decided to keep the $999 starting price for a while longer. There&rsquo;s a catch, though, as that price tag is for the M1 model, which stays in the line-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Display of M2 MacBook Air</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first hints we got of a redesigned MacBook Air chassis came from leaker Jon Prosser in late 2021. Prosser claimed to have seen a photo of a light blue MacBook Air with a much flatter chassis &mdash; a design that did away with the famous tapered edge that the MacBook Air has used since its inception. Extrapolating from that photo, Prosser predicted the MacBook Air range would come in an array of bright colors, much like the 24-inch iMac.</p>
<p>In the end, Prosser was half right. The MacBook Air did indeed ditch the tapered edge, and blue is a color option in the refreshed line-up. However, we didn&rsquo;t see any other bright colors, and Apple is instead offering the laptop in silver, Space Gray, and Starlight alongside the blue shade.</p>
<p>In its WWDC presentation, Apple claimed the new design is 20% less voluminous than the previous MacBook Air, which is pretty impressive considering the M1 MacBook Air was 0.16 inches at its thinnest point.</p>
<p>Prosser also made a number of claims about the keyboard and trackpad, namely that the new MacBook Air&rsquo;s keyboard would feature full-sized function keys, as opposed to the squat versions on the current model. Prosser was right on that count, so you should find it a little easier to use those keys if you get the M2 MacBook Air. That change, however, would push the rest of the keyboard down, Prosser claimed, which in turn would mean the trackpad would be slightly smaller. In the end, the M2 MacBook Air&rsquo;s chassis is 0.1 inches longer than the M1 version, and while Apple doesn&rsquo;t give measurements for its trackpad, that extra size might mean it remains the same size as its M1 counterpart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. A notch and a 1080p webcam</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit of Jon Prosser&rsquo;s leaks was that the MacBook Air would adopt the same display notch as the MacBook Pro. This has been a contentious design decision ever since its inception on the Mac (and for longer still on the iPhone). In the end, though, Apple pushed ahead and brought the notch to the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The company did this by thinning down the bezels around the sides of the display. Now, the screen edges are wafer thin, except around the webcam cut-out &mdash; producing what has become known as the notch.</p>
<h2><br />4. No mini-LED display</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before WWDC, there were rumors that Apple could bring mini-LED tech to the MacBook Air&rsquo;s display. This was always an outlandish claim given that mini-LED technology is a high-end feature that makes much more sense in a professional device like the MacBook Pro, and in the end, it never made it into the M2 MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Yet that doesn&rsquo;t mean the screen is completely without merit or upgrades. A more accurate rumor came from Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) analyst Ross Young, who asserted that Apple might increase the MacBook Air display slightly from 13.3 inches to 13.6 inches. This time, the rumor was proven true, as Apple did indeed increase the display&rsquo;s real estate thanks to the reduced bezels.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the brightness was bumped up to 500 nits, an increase over the M1 model&rsquo;s 400 nits, and it now supports one billion colors. However, as with the lack of a mini-LED panel, there&rsquo;s also no 120Hz ProMotion technology either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. The next-gen M2 chip</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Apple was going to launch a MacBook Air at WWDC 2022, one thing was almost certain: It would come with a new M2 chip. Given the audience of developers who would need to know what they&rsquo;ll be working with, it made a lot of sense. And in the end, we got what we expected, with the new MacBook Air getting an equally new M2 chip inside.</p>
<p>Built on a 5-nanometer process, the M2 features 20 billion transistors, which is 25% more than the M1. It also features a 100GBps memory controller, which is 50% more than the M1. There&rsquo;s an eight-core CPU (with four performance cores and four efficiency cores), an eight-core GPU, and up to 24GB of unified memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. The return of MagSafe</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most welcome changes in the new MacBook Air is the return of MagSafe. No, not Apple&rsquo;s magnetic iPhone charging tech. The original MagSafe featured a charging cable that magnetically attached to your MacBook, meaning it would snap free if it was accidentally yanked, preventing your laptop from smashing onto the floor. It&rsquo;s been absent from the MacBook Air since Apple discontinued the last MagSafe MacBook Air in 2019.</p>
<p>Before WWDC, both reporter Mark Gurman and leaker Jon Prosser said it would make a happy return, and both were vindicated on this front.</p>
<p>Aside from that, Gurman believed the MacBook Air would come with two USB4 ports. Prosser simply stated it would have two USB-C ports, although he didn&rsquo;t outline whether they would be USB4. In the end, Apple confirmed the ports are USB4.</p>

<p>Since the past few years, <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> has emerged as a leading tech and product manufacturing giant who has stood out with its sheer innovation and quality of products. With its inventions and meticulous attention to detail, Apple has become a trend-setter. Computers became sleek and user-friendly with Macintosh. Similarly, Apple taught people how to listen to music properly through the iPod and iTunes. Similarly, the iPhone provided users with everything they had never imagined they needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Apple and Innovation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple showers its customers with gifts: fantastic software packaged in gorgeous hardware ("very good ideas wrapped up in other extremely good ideas," as Michael Lopp, senior engineering manager at Apple, puts it). Apple is also a forerunner in new company sectors and market segments. The iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad are just a some of the company's game-changing advancements.</p>
<p>Apple's innovation executives think in terms of platforms and pipelines, and they are persistent in their pursuit of new ideas. Competitors who chase Apple's current release fall behind when Apple presents its latest and greatest product a few months later.</p>
<p>Concentrating on areas where they can make a major difference, Apple seeks out brilliant innovators who strive to create the finest products possible.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs once said, &ldquo;Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.&rdquo; He has rightly said the above line. Staying loyal to his ideology, Apple manages to think ahead and works on products ahead of time. These are a few products that have been in the pipeline for a couple of years now and are expected to launch in the coming years.</p>
<p>List of Apple Products expected to launch in the future</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Larger iMac</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the release of the 24-inch iMac, rumors say that Apple is now working on a Larger iMac expected to have a display size ranging between 27 to 32 inches with a mini LED display. The screen is expected to have slimmer bezels and may support XDR and Promotion.</p>
<p>Other than the increase in display size, the new iMac is expected to get a top-end M1 chip such as the M1 Pro or M1 Max or any chip from the upcoming M2 series. But rumors suggest that we won&rsquo;t see it until 2023!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. AR/VR headset</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomberg first reported in 2017 that Apple plans to launch its AR headset in 2020 sometime. The same year, Financial Times suggested that Apple plans on launching its AR Glasses with 3D cameras. Apple confirmed in 2019 that it is working on &lsquo;some&rsquo; kind of Augmented Reality device, adding fire to the rumors.</p>
<p>Kuo believes that AR glasses will be heavily dependent on iPhones, just like the first generation of Apple Watches. Apple is probably working on reducing the weight of the glasses because they need not weigh heavier than standard glasses but have to manage the hardware with the same weight.</p>
<p>In the previous years, Apple has filed many patents claiming new technologies to provide 3D virtual views of a user&rsquo;s environment with virtual content. While I am relying on Augmented Reality Glasses&rsquo; generic idea as their upcoming device, but considering Apple&rsquo;s innovation heights, it can be a new device as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>3. Affordable iPad</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many rumors are circulating that Apple is working on an affordable version of the iPad to expand the market share, which they have already been dominating. These rumors are only on the cloud, and we may not hear anything regarding this from Apple, at least for this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Apple Car</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple had announced autonomous cars in 2015. Since then, we have heard a lot of rumors regarding the same. These autonomous cars are expected to be electric cars operating on battery sources, might even go solar in their energy consumption.</p>
<p>Apple will likely to have a tie-up with Hyundai to produce these cars by 2024 and get them in the market by 2030. However, Apple did seek permission to test 200 cars in 2017 in California under the name Project Titan.</p>
<p>Apple Cars look promising and support Apple&rsquo;s vision of going Carbon Neutral by 2030. I admire one rumor in particular, which is the use of Apple ID as car keys. The car also claims to feature the infamous LiDAR scanners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5. Foldable iPhones</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple has been planning to launch foldable iPhones in the coming two years, which will be two screens connected with a hinge. Despite the hinge, the iPhone looks flawless and doesn&rsquo;t seem to look like two screens connected.</p>
<p>A Taiwanese website, Economic Daily News, has also claimed that two of these models passed durability tests earlier, completed at the Foxconn factory in Shenzhen, China.</p>
<p>Other than that, rumors suggest that Apple is also working on a Foldable Macbook. But as of now, we don&rsquo;t have much info on either of the Foldable devices from Apple.</p>
<p>So, this concludes our list of Apple products that are expected to launch someday in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/lighting/litra-glow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logitech Litra Glow&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not a fan of ring and halo lights, this futuristic gadget should be on your buying list! Logitech&rsquo;s Litra Glow clips to the top of your laptop, emitting a wide and soft glow, and while it&rsquo;s technically designed for streamers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitch gamers who haven&rsquo;t slept in two days and would benefit from some flattering lighting&ndash;it&rsquo;ll more than do the job for everyday work meetings. You can adjust the brightness and color temperatures to find the best light for your skin tone, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. <a href="https://www.sky.com/glass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Glass&nbsp;</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An intuitive, minimalist 4K QLED TV that functions without an aerial dish, Sky&rsquo;s new all-in-one entertainment system does things a little differently. It is available in three sizes and five colors. You can pick one of several pricing plans on a 24-or-48-month basis instead of buying the screen outright, plus a Sky TV streaming subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. <a href="https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/pro-us.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Therabody TheraFace Pro</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TheraFace Pro is a percussive device that comes with a trio of smooth silicone attachments, a multi-spectrum LED light ring that boosts collagen production, and a microcurrent capability that tones facial muscles. We were impressed when we tested it out at launch, and we think it&rsquo;s a great option for people who hold a lot of tension around their jaw. There are also heat and cryo attachments, available separately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay Portal</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bang &amp; Olufsen&rsquo;s new wireless Beoplay Portal matches understated design with the kind of technical features you need on a Modern Warfare session: lossless connection, four separate mics for impeccably crisp communication, surround sound with Dolby Atmos and active noise cancellation. Getting relentlessly ridiculed by American teenagers has never sounded better.</p>
<h2><br />5. TEAC TN-280BT-A3 Turntable</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The vinyl resurgence shows no sign of stopping. After years of offering our lives up to The Cloud, it&rsquo;s clear that people are interested in owning things again &ndash; specifically, a well-curated collection of LPs. But the next step is to find a record player that looks as good as it sounds. Opt for TEAC&rsquo;s Seventies-style &lsquo;TN-280BT-A3&rsquo; in walnut, a 2-speed belt drive turntable that features built in Bluetooth, which means no tricky wiring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Philips 3-in-1 Air Purifier, Fan &amp; Heater</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ever heard a 3-in-one object: an air purifier, a fan and a heater, all wrapped up into one sleek package? The fan and the heater are natural adversaries, after all, and the addition of an air purifier would surely guarantee that any such device would end up as large, ugly and spluttering as a 1950s computer. But Philips has created a true triple threat with the 3-in-1: the fan oscillates 350&deg;, ensuring that (warm or refreshing, but always purified) air is distributed around the room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Dodow Sleep Aid Device</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you struggling and finding it hard to sleep? It might be that you&rsquo;re struggling to turn your brain off. There are plenty of mindfulness methods you can apply to fix that, but Dodow is perhaps the simplest tech-based approach. It&rsquo;s a simple device that projects a blue light onto your ceiling at a metronomic pace (for 8 to 20 minutes), which you match to your breath. Take a breath in when it expands, and breath out when it retracts. You should find that focussing your attention on the exercise calms your mind, and you&rsquo;ll be off to sleep in no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. LARQ Water Pitcher</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LARQ&rsquo;s self-cleaning bottles strip tap water of harmful bacteria and chemicals, eliminating 99.8% of E.coli in a 20-second cycle. It&rsquo;s all very impressive stuff, and you can really taste the difference in the quality of your water. So the Bay Area-based startup&rsquo;s decision to reinvent the humble pitcher is a good one &ndash; it uses advanced technology to get rid of chlorine, mercury, cadmium, copper and all that nasty stuff, and can track your water intake on the app (the filters also last a surprisingly long time.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Theragun PRO Limited Edition Gold-Plated Massager</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Salt Bae has taught us anything, beyond messy seasoning methods, it&rsquo;s that covering something in gold is the key to success. So it goes without saying that your workout would benefit from this gold-plated Theragun PRO, of which only 550 have been made (a bespoke serial number is engraved on the device.) You can read our full review of the device (sans gold) in our best massage gun round-up here. Another cool and futuristic tech gadget, Theragun PRO Limited will only cost you &pound;1000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Samsung Wireless Charger</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last to be on the list of futuristic tech gadgets is Samsung. While enlisting futuristic gadgets in 2022, we cannot exclude Samsung&rsquo;s cutting-edge technology and innovation. It may be a Samsung device, but this affordable and unobtrusive wireless charger works with Apple and Android phones too, as well as headphones that are set up for the feature. An LED light lets you know when the charge is finished, dimming at night so as not to disturb your sleep, and the 9W Fast Charging support ensures that you&rsquo;ll get the job done quickly.</p>
<p>So, this concludes our list of 10 futuristic tech gadgets. Over the past few years, technology has been amazing us with its potential and boundaries. For now, we are sure that technology is limitless and our affinity to leverage and harness it to its true potential is boundless.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="../banking-finance/top-automated-expense-tracking-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Top 5 Automated Expense Tracking Apps to Look Out in 2022</a></strong></p>85:Tb1c,<p>In a piece of recent news, <strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsungs-new-memory-cards-are-made-to-record-over-a-decade-of-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung has launched</a></strong> the upgraded versions of its PRO Endurance microSD cards. These PRO Endurance microSD cards are designed for years of use, making them roughly double the life of the original models.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The PRO Endurance microSD cards</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung PRO Endurance microSD cards come in 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, and 256GB options.</p>
<p>32GB and 64GB cards write at up to 30MB/s, while the 128GB and 256GB cards write at up to 40MB/s. All sizes read at 100MB/s.</p>
<p>Samsung launched a brand-new upgraded series of its Pro Endurance microSD cards that are designed to record video for years at a time. The previous generation of Samsung Pro Endurance microSD cards could record up to 43,800 hours of video over the lifetime of the card, but Samsung has upgraded the new 128GB model with the ability to record up to 70,080 hours, while the 256GB model can sustain 140,160 hours of continuously recorded video. That's 16 years of video, for note.</p>
<p>While these could be used on a phone with expandable storage support &mdash; something our readers want to see more of &mdash; it's more important for those types of microSD cards to have very high read speeds. Instead, these cards are specifically designed for the best security cameras with local storage because they're meant to have long-term video overwritten instead of ultra-high-quality video quickly written to them. In short, one of these cards will last as long as 33 high-speed cards in a constantly-recording security camera according to Samsung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Durable and Impressively Affordable</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Samsung specifically highlighted the fact that all sizes of its upgraded Pro Endurance cards are rated for U3 and V30 speeds, which means they're fully able to handle constant 1080p and 4K video recording. They've also been reinforced to withstand the elements, including protection against water, magnets, x-rays, and even extreme operating temperatures of -25c/-13f to 85c/185f degrees. That's particularly great for outdoor cameras.</p>
<p>Samsung is selling the 32GB card for an impressively affordable $10.99, while a 64GB version is only $14.99. Ramping up to 128GB is a bit more at $27.99, while the longest-lasting 256GB card will run $54.99. If you're looking to pick one of the new-gen models up, be sure to check the specs before buying to ensure you're getting one of the longer-lasting models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Data Derived from Amazon Echo</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Titled &ldquo;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Your Echoes are Heard: Tracking, Profiling, and Ad Targeting in the Amazon Smart Speaker Ecosystem</a>,&rdquo; the report concludes that Amazon and third parties (including advertising and tracking services) collect data from your interactions with Alexa through Amazon Echo smart speakers and share it with as many as 41 advertising partners. That data is then used to infer user interests and serve targeted ads on-platform (Amazon Echo devices) as well as off-platform (web). It also concludes that this type of data is in hot demand, leading to 30X higher ad bids from advertisers.</p>
<p>The report has been produced by researchers affiliated with the University of Washington, UC Davis, UC Irvine, and Northeastern University and says the ways Amazon does this is inconsistent with its privacy policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Opting out of Privacy Infringement</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon confirmed that it does use voice data from Alexa interactions to inform relevant ads shown on Amazon or other sites where Amazon places ads. &ldquo;<em>Similar to what you&rsquo;d experience if you made a purchase on Amazon.com or requested a song through Amazon Music, if you ask Alexa to order paper towels or to play a song on Amazon Music, the record of that purchase or song play may inform relevant ads shown on Amazon or other sites where Amazon places ads.</em>&rdquo; Amazon spokesperson Lauren Raemhild said in an email.</p>
<p>For Alexa devices, there are additional privacy controls managed through Settings &gt; Alexa Privacy in the Alexa app or at amazon.com/alexaprivacysettings. Here, you can see and manage your voice recordings as well as manage the permissions granted to skills. To manage third-party skills advertising preferences, you will need to go to their app or website.</p>

<p>News of Twitter's buyout has rattled Twitter employees and users, as Musk has indicated he plans to take a much more hands-off approach to content moderation. As is often the case when Twitter makes a controversial change, some users have threatened to leave the platform, while critics have pushed #RIPTWITTER to trend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Viable Alternative to Twitter</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Mastodon has been in the spotlight as a potentially viable Twitter alternative in the past, it has yet to reach the mainstream. But its current popularity comes at a moment when Twitter is also exploring how it could become an open-sourced protocol &mdash; much like Mastodon.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter, Mastodon is not a single, centralized service. Though the interface looks similar to Twitter &mdash; it has a 500-character limit but otherwise will be mostly recognizable to Twitter users &mdash; it runs on an open-source protocol. Groups of users are free to create and maintain their own &ldquo;instances&rdquo; with their own rules around membership, moderation and other key policies. Users are also able to take their followers with them between instances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Open-source Social Media Network</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mastodon operates its own instances, mastodon.social and mastodon.online, but those are apparently overloaded, according to Rochko, who suggests that new users sign up via the official apps and join other communities on the service. And, because it&rsquo;s open source, Mastodon makes its code available on GitHub, an idea Musk has also endorsed with regards to Twitter&rsquo;s algorithms.</p>
<p>But all that also comes with extra complexity for new users who may not easily understand Mastodon&rsquo;s unique structure or how it works. But those who stick around long enough may see some significant new features. Rochko said that end-to-end encrypted messaging is in the works, as well as &ldquo;an exciting groups functionality.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Vanishing of the Google&rsquo;s Snapshot Feature</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Google&rsquo;s Snapshot feature, which could be accessed via a small and easily overlooked inbox icon on the Assistant screen, would show all your current information via a scrollable interface &mdash; things such as appointments, weather forecasts, traffic, and reminders. It was a small but useful feature &mdash; unfortunately, though, it was also not easy to find unless you knew where to look. As a result, it&rsquo;s probable that not many Android users actually knew about it.</p>
<p>So it was almost inevitable that the company would eventually announce that Google&rsquo;s Snapshot feature was going to be sunsetted &mdash; which it did when it began running notices within the app back in March. And now 9to5Google is reporting that the feature seems to have disappeared completely from Android phones. (Certainly, it&rsquo;s not on my Pixel 6 phone running Android 12, although it was still available on my original Pixel running Android 10.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive Digital Personal Assistant</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If <strong><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/04/13/google-assistant-snapshot-appears-to-finally-sadly-be-gone-for-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Snapshot</a></strong> hasn&rsquo;t disappeared from your Android phone yet, it&rsquo;s about to. Google has been trying out apps meant to gather and present us with our personal information for years. It created Google Now back in 2012 to act as a comprehensive digital personal assistant; that app was slowly phased out over the years in favor of the much more interactive (and verbal) Google Assistant, and its collections of visual info were (sort of) replaced by Snapshot.</p>
<p>You can now count Snapshot as one with all the other Google apps that have gone to their graves. If you are a Snapshot fan and want to get the information that used to be available, Google has published a support page with the various places you can find that data. Or you can simply say &ldquo;Hey, Google, what do I have scheduled for today?&rdquo;</p>

That isn&rsquo;t quite changing today &mdash; but a company called Lambda is now putting Ubuntu on a souped-up version of last year&rsquo;s Razer Blade 15 Advanced with Razer&rsquo;s full blessing, with the aim of selling it to machine learning and artificial intelligence researchers. The Razer x Lambda Tensorbook might create a steer in the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Razer x Lambda Tensorbook</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called the Razer x Lambda Tensorbook, and the $3,500 machine is absolutely identical to a high-end version of last year&rsquo;s laptop in most ways. It&rsquo;s got an 11th-gen Intel Core i7 CPU, Nvidia RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics and 64GB of RAM underneath a 15.6-inch 165Hz 1440p display, all powered by a 80Wh battery inside an identically sized and shaped 4.45-pound chassis. It&rsquo;s also got the same speedy I/O, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports, three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a UHS-III SD card reader and both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.</p>
<p>But the Tensorbook is silver instead of black, and comes preinstalled with &ldquo;the latest drivers and machine learning tools including PyTorch, Tensorflow, CUDA, and cuDNN,&rdquo; its own warranty and &mdash; if you pay $4,099 and up &mdash; its own premium support team. Lambda says it provides hardware to thousands of research groups already, selling GPUs, servers, and desktop workstations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The Blade Lineup</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Razer currently offers faster CPU, GPU and screens in today&rsquo;s Blade lineup, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad deal if you love the design, considering how pricey Razer&rsquo;s laptops can be. But we&rsquo;ve generally found that Razer&rsquo;s thin machines run quite hot in our reviews, and the Blade in question was no exception even with a quarter of the memory and a less powerful RTX 3060 GPU. Lambda&rsquo;s FAQ page does not address heat as of today.</p>
<p>Lambda is clearly aiming this one at prospective MacBook Pro buyers, and I don&rsquo;t just say that because of the silver tones. The primary hardware comparison the company touts is a 4x speedup over Apple&rsquo;s M1 Max in a 16-inch MacBook Pro when running TensorFlow. Razer has teased better Linux support over the years, but popular Linux computing news site Phoronix wrote in 2019 that those plans had seemingly been mothballed. Perhaps the recently renewed interest in Linux gaming, driven by the Steam Deck, will push Razer to consider Linux for its own core products as well.</p>

These rumors come hot on the heels of Apple releasing the Mac Studio, and its announcement that the the M1 Ultra would be the last chip in its current-gen lineup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>M2-Powered MacBook Air</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bloomberg isn&rsquo;t predicting a replacement for the Studio yet, but it reports that most other Mac models will be getting an upgrade. Gurman says he&rsquo;s seen evidence of an M2-powered MacBook Air with a 10-core GPU &mdash; contrary to previous predictions that a redesigned Air would still have an M1 &mdash; as well as an entry-level M2 MacBook Pro with the same specs. The 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros also make an appearance, along with a new Mac Mini and Mac Pro, all rocking next-gen Apple silicon. A Mac Mini with the current-gen M1 Pro also cropped up, though it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that making it to market now that the Mac Studio exists.</p>
<p>The higher-end machines will reportedly have M2 Pro and M2 Max chips, with the Max having 12 CPU cores and 38 graphics cores (two CPU and six GPU cores extra compared to the current M1 Max). Bloomberg doesn&rsquo;t include details on the breakdown of efficiency and performance cores. The M2 Pro also shows up as an option for the Mac Mini, and Gurman predicts that the Mac Pro will have a &ldquo;successor to the M1 Ultra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Apple&rsquo;s chips are on the table</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entry-level MacBook Pro may stick around, however, still be barely differentiated from the Air. Whenever I discuss laptops with my colleagues, they usually predict that Apple will quietly discontinue the 13-inch model, given that it seems like an unhappy medium between the Air and the 14-inch Pro. It&rsquo;s also a bit of an outlier with its Touch Bar, but it&rsquo;s an open question whether the successor will have one &mdash; the Bloomberg report doesn&rsquo;t say.</p>
<p>Notably absent from the list of computers is any sort of iMac. There&rsquo;s no mention of a successor to the M1-powered 24-inch all-in-one, or a replacement for the recently discontinued 27-inch iMac. Tnformation comes from developer logs, which presumably showed up because Apple was testing its new computers using third-party apps. While it wasn&rsquo;t hard to predict that Apple would be working on the next generation of chips, it&rsquo;s exciting to see evidence of their existence out in the wild, and to get early details.</p>
<p>It may not be that long of a wait before an official announcement of at least a few of these computers &mdash; Bloomberg reports that &ldquo;at least two Macs&rdquo; could launch &ldquo;around the middle of the year.&rdquo; And wouldn't you know it, WWDC is on the calendar for June 6th.</p>

So, what could be the possible advantages offered by <strong><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/07/googles-multisearch-search-using-text-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google&rsquo;s Multisearch</a></strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Google Lens Multisearch</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting announcements at Google&rsquo;s Search-focused keynote in September was a big upgrade to Lens that lets you take a photo and ask questions about it. &ldquo;Multisearch&rdquo; in Google Lens is now available to beta test on Android and iOS.</p>
<p>Multisearch is Google&rsquo;s &ldquo;entirely new way to search&rdquo; that aims to address how you sometimes don&rsquo;t &ldquo;have all the words to describe what you were looking for.&rdquo; It starts by taking a picture (or importing an existing one) with Google Lens and then swiping up on the results panel and tapping the new &ldquo;Add to your search&rdquo; button at the top. This will let you enter a &ldquo;question about an object in front of you or refine your search by color, brand or a visual attribute.&rdquo; Examples include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Latest Advancements in Artificial Intelligence</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshot a stylish orange dress and add the query &ldquo;green&rdquo; to find it in another color</li>
<li>Snap a photo of your dining set and add the query &ldquo;coffee table&rdquo; to find a matching table&nbsp;</li>
<li>Take a picture of your rosemary plant and add the query &ldquo;care instructions&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Fashion and home decor use cases are prominently highlighted today, with Google noting that &ndash; currently &ndash; the &ldquo;best results [are] for shopping searches.&rdquo; That said, the last example above means you don&rsquo;t have to first use Lens to identify a plant and then perform a separate text search for &ldquo;care instructions&rdquo; after identification.</p>
<p>Google credits the &ldquo;latest advancements in artificial intelligence&rdquo; as making possible Lens multisearch. That said, it&rsquo;s not using the Multitask Unified Model and can&rsquo;t handle complex queries yet. For example, MUM was responsible for the demo where you could take a picture of broken bicycle gears and get instructions on how to repair. Google Lens multisearch today is officially a beta in English in the US. You can access it from the Google app on Android and iOS.</p>

Since at least the end of March, the social media network has started showing a blank box on external sites when an embedded tweets have been deleted. The change was detailed in a blog post from Kevin Marks.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a big change from how Twitter used to handle deleted-yet-embedded tweets, when it would preserve the original unformatted text. With this recent change, that text is now gone, leaving a hole inside any story that embedded it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Embedded Tweets</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Twitter senior product manager Eleanor Harding, the change was made &ldquo;to better respect when people have chosen to delete their tweets.&rdquo; But it also impacts any tweets that have been removed for other reasons, like when the account that posted them has been suspended.</p>

<p>The biggest example here is the account of former US President Donald Trump, whose account was suspended in early 2021. It means that hundreds of articles that embedded tweets of Trump&rsquo;s posts no longer work, in a classic case of &ldquo;link rot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that Trump&rsquo;s tweets are gone forever. Since his suspension from the platform third-party archives have emerged to catalog his posts, and other services exist to track deleted tweets from public officials. But Twitter&rsquo;s change makes it a lot harder to view these tweets in the context of the news stories written about them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Javascript for Tweets</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As noted by Marks, Twitter is using its embedded Javascript to blank out the tweets. To see the original text you can disable Javascript in your browser. It&rsquo;s odd, to say the least, that Twitter would make a change of this magnitude without some kind of warning. Twitter seems to have rolled out the change even before updating its support documents that still describe the old behavior of deleted tweets. The Verge has reached out to Twitter for comment and will update this story with any response.</p>

<p>News of Twitter&rsquo;s changes to embedded tweets and deleted tweets has emerged just hours after the company officially announced it was working on an edit button for the service, allowing users to change the contents of tweets after they&rsquo;ve been posted. The feature has prompted concerns that users will be able to edit statements that are an important matter of public record.</p>

Several large firms and organizations have been participating in the race to secure ideal spots in the newly emerged digital space, called the Metaverse. Moreover, <a href="https://techilive.in/tech-leaders-create-proofs-of-concept-for-the-metaverse/">companies like Meta are introducing their own unique concepts to secure the hotspot in this Metaverse</a>.</p>

<p>In this digitally pivoted race, e-commerce companies like Amazon are unwilling to be behind and watch others move ahead. Therefore, the company has recently introduced a unique way to keep the flame alive and train its employees to participate in the cause and win the race. The game, called the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Massively-Multiplayer-Online-Role-Playing-Games-ebook/dp/B002UKOK36">Online Role-playing game</a>, is indeed one of its kind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_wrxgg2kwypwt"></a><strong>Online Role-playing Game</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On 15 March 2022, Amazon launched an online role-playing game designed to make it easier for people to pick up cloud-computing skills. The game, AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner, has users create their own avatar who moves through a virtual city, helping its denizens solve technology-related cloud issues.</p>

<p>Users earn points for completing Amazon Web Services simulations and puzzles that will unlock such things as new character styles, pet companions, city themes and virtual items like a hoverboard and a unicorn pool float. &ldquo;<em>As a cloud practitioner, you&rsquo;ll venture on a journey to help the citizens in town transform their city by using cloud solutions</em>,&rdquo; AWS said in a YouTube video announcing the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_7qto1427ir9r"></a><strong>Likes of the game</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one scenario shown in the video, a cartoon man in a hard hat approaches a user and says, &ldquo;<em>The server running my weather app keeps failing! Can you help me, please?</em>&rdquo; Amazon said Cloud Quest was launched to help explain &ldquo;core AWS services and categories,&rdquo; including computing, storage, database and security services, as well as to guide the building of basic cloud solutions. In addition to the quirky online game, Amazon has launched other cloud-training services. AWS offers a range of certifications to help employees advance their careers and cloud expertise.</p>8f:Ta48,<p>In a piece of latest news, Amazon has officially launched its cloud gaming services in the US. Although it took Amazon a year and a half, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page">Amazon Luna</a> cloud gaming service finally exists as more than an early access project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_81yqadjlz8jb"></a><strong>Amazon Luna and Luna+</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon has formally launched Luna in the mainland US for Android, iOS, Chrome OS, macOS and Windows. The core Amazon Luna+ service with over 100 games will normally cost $10 per month, with the kid-friendly Family Channel and Ubisoft+ Channels available for a respective $6 and $18 per month. Amazon hopes to reel in newcomers by dropping the monthly fees of Luna+ and the Family channel to $6 and $3 for anyone who signs up during March. Existing users just have to maintain their subscriptions to lock-in that pricing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_48nsp6mx7zf"></a><strong>Official Debut of Amazon Luna</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The official debut comes alongside some new channels. A Prime Gaming channel, as the name implies, gives Amazon Prime members a free, rotating mix of games. The March selection will include titles like Devil May Cry 5 and Flashback. Users can pay $5 per month for the Retro Channel and get Capcom and SNK classics like Street Fighter II Hyper Fighting and Metal Slug 3, while a similar outlay for the Jackbox Games Channel provides access to all eight Jackbox Party Pack titles.</p>

<p>Amazon Luna&#39;s latest update also makes it simpler to stream gameplay from a Fire TV device, Mac or Windows PC on Twitch. Users will need a webcam and mic if they want to interact with viewers, but this might be an option if they are determined to broadcast and don&#39;t have a brawny-enough computer to play demanding locally-stored games.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="_t3inlmd1ie9i"></a><strong>Challenges Induced</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon&#39;s challenge, as with comparable services like Microsoft&#39;s Game Pass Ultimate, is to convince players that subscription-based game streaming is a good supplement or even replacement for conventional PC and console gaming experiences.</p>

<p>Users will have the convenience of playing on seemingly every device they own, but they will also be limited by what they can play and the quality of the internet connection. Amazon&#39;s main advantage is its ubiquity &mdash; it can make sure people are aware Luna exists, whether they&#39;re watching on Twitch or buying a Fire TV gadget for the living room.</p>90:T8a8,<p>Increasing concerns for cybersecurity are rapidly worrying large organizations and firms. Cyberattacks have become a common concern for several companies, particularly sectors like manufacturing, automobile, and others.</p>

<p>n a piece of latest breaking news, Toyota has reportedly halted vehicle production at all its plants in Japan following a cyberattack against a major supplier, <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/">Nikkei </a>has reported. The company, in a latest statement, has reported a halt in its production and operation due to alleged system failure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Halt on Operations</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, automobile manufacturing giant Toyota cited operation halt due to operation failure. In its global website, the company wrote, &ldquo;<em>Due to a system failure at a domestic supplier (Kojima Industries Corporation), we have decided to suspend the operation of 28 lines at 14 plants in Japan on Tuesday, March 1st</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kojima supplies both exterior and interior parts, including components used in its air-conditioning system and steering wheel. The parts weren&#39;t affected but Kojima was reportedly unable to communicate with Toyota or monitor production. The issue affected Toyota&#39;s just in time manufacturing system that requires parts be delivered just before they&#39;re installed so they don&#39;t have to be stocked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>No Confirmation of Cyberattacks</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Toyota did not mention a cyberattack on its website, although Kojima confirmed the issue. &quot;<em>It is true that we have been hit by some kind of cyberattack. We are still confirming the damage and we are hurrying to respond, with the top priority of resuming Toyota&#39;s production system as soon as possible,</em>&quot; a Kojima official told Nikkei.</p>

<p>Two other Toyota partners were reportedly hit, including truck manufacturer Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor. The origins of the cyberattack, type of malware and other details have not been revealed. Toyota did not say when it expects to restart the manufacturing lines, but the Japanese government is reportedly involved in the investigation.</p>91:Td63,<p>Over the past couple of years, Samsung has been heavily leaning towards sustainable approaches with its products and devices. The company, lately, has been seeking sustainability and trying to make impactful initiatives towards the ecosystem. In a piece of recent news, the tech company has announced that its upcoming Galaxy devices will be partly made from recycled fishing nets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>&lsquo;Galaxy for the Planet Program&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lately, Samsung has been pushing for a greener world with slogans like &lsquo;<a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/sustainability/">corporate citizenship</a>&rsquo; and a big push for environmentally friendly supply chain, materials and manufacturing. As a part of its &lsquo;<a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/tag/galaxy-for-the-planet">Galaxy for the Planet</a>&rsquo; Program along with other programs like upcycling, abandonment of plastic packaging, Samsung&rsquo;s latest remodeling includes repurposing discarded fishing nets for its devices.</p>

<p>The tech giant will announce its <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-unpacked-2022-1h-livestream-video/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=unpacked">2022 Galaxy S lineup</a> on 9 Feb and the upcoming phones will be partly made from new and more sustainable material. Samsung said it has started using ocean-bound plastic made from discarded fishing nets in its latest devices. The company also said it would incorporate the material first into the upcoming products before it eventually begins utilizing it throughout its entire device lineup.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Striving for Sustainable Approaches</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Samsung is not the first company to incorporate discarded trash into its devices. In 2021, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/microsoft-ocean-plastic-mouse/8xh06gbzm3nd?ranMID=24542&amp;ranEAID=tv2R4u9rImY&amp;ranSiteID=tv2R4u9rImY-3SibU_Nyhg61OI3gsLvSDg&amp;epi=tv2R4u9rImY-3SibU_Nyhg61OI3gsLvSDg&amp;irgwc=1&amp;OCID=AID2200057_aff_7593_1243925&amp;tduid=%28ir__toqwahwy90kf6yf0naako9wmo32xtxvjufnuukdz00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28tv2R4u9rImY-3SibU_Nyhg61OI3gsLvSDg%29%28%29&amp;irclickid=_toqwahwy90kf6yf0naako9wmo32xtxvjufnuukdz00">Ocean Plastic Mouse</a>, featuring a shell made from 20 percent recovered plastic.</p>

<p>Like Microsoft, Samsung is positioning its use of ocean-bound plastics as part of its larger sustainability push. In 2019, under pressure from consumers and environmentalists, the company said it would begin using more sustainable materials in the packaging of its devices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Major Contributors of Ocean Debris</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ocean pollution is a recent topic of concern for scientists and marine biologists. While plastic bottles and grocery bags are the main reasons of ocean debris, microplastics and discarded nets are the major contributors as well.</p>

<p>For instance, derelict fishing gear leads to <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ghostfishing.html">ghost fishing</a>, a phenomenon where those tools continue to trap and kill marine life, including endangered species like the Hawaiian monk seal. With more than 640,000 tons worth of fishing nets discarded every year, the problem is only worsening with each passing day.</p>92:Tbf5,<p>After a series of offers and negotiations, the teen who tracked Musk&rsquo;s private jet and updated its locations has rejected Musk&rsquo;s offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Denial of the Offer</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/elon-musk-offered-a-19-year-old-5000-to-take-down-a-twitter-account-that-tracks-his-private-jet-report-says/articleshow/89157457.cms">Previously</a>, Jack Sweeney, the teenager who tracked Elon Musk&rsquo;s private jet rejected the offer of getting a free Tesla in exchange for deleting the former&rsquo;s Twitter account. However, he rejected the offer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 19-year-old Twitter user was famous for his track updates on the Tesla CEO&rsquo;s privat jet. According to his statements, he was previously offered a free Tesla from Musk in exchange for deleting the account. Prior to that, he had rejected an offer of $5000 from the Tesla CEO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Aggravation of Counter Offers</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past, <strong>Scott Painter</strong>, CEO of Autonomy, a car hire company, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheScottPainter/status/1489615209924743168">offered</a> Sweeney a subscription to a Tesla Model 3 if he deleted the Musk jet-tracking account. According to reports, the offer was for a three-year subscription. To which, Sweeney responded a disinterest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During an interview, Sweeney explained the reason behind his decision. &ldquo;<em>I want my own car. I don&rsquo;t want to have to give it back in three years. If I got an actual Tesla, then I would take it down</em>,&rdquo; he said. Sweeney&rsquo;s jet-tracking account uses bots that monitor publicly available air traffic data. After turning down $5,000 from Musk to delete the account, reports state that he refused the offer as it was not enough for him to replace the satisfaction he gets from running the account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Timeline of &lsquo;Offer&rsquo; Events</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Jan 27 2022, Sweeney received a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/technology/elon-musk-jet-tracking.html">private message</a> on Twitter from Musk himself that said, &ldquo;<em>Can you take this down? It is a security risk</em>.&rdquo; To which, Sweeney responded that it will cost him a Model 3 in order to take down the account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, Musk made a counteroffer of $5000 &ldquo;<em>for this account and generally helping make it harder for crazy people to track him?</em>&rdquo; To which, Sweeney nodded with a revised charge of $50k, citing college funding. He further quoted the billionaire that the money could go toward buying a Tesla Model 3.</p>

<p>According to reports, Musk said he would think about it but took days to get back in touch with Sweeney. When Sweeney told Musk where he was aggregating the data from, Musk responded, &ldquo;<em>Air traffic control is so primitive</em>.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;</p>93:T19e7,<p>IoT has been recognised as a technology that holds the potential to super boost business and enrich almost every aspect of our lives. Weekly,&nbsp;we are witnessing incredible life-changing IoT innovations&nbsp;across telehealth, smart cities, EV charging and environment, the connected supply chain, intelligent manufacturing and more. The sky is the limit when it comes to IoT-enabled enhancements and COVID-19 only served to cement IoT&rsquo;s place in the new normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, despite the&nbsp;considerable innovation and enormous explosion&nbsp;in IoT technologies, devices and services, global cellular IoT connections today, at 1.7 billion, vastly falls short of the projected potential in the early years of the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With creativity and innovation in abundance, we can only look to the&nbsp;ongoing MNO connectivity restrictions around &lsquo;permanent roaming&rsquo;&nbsp;as the limiting factor that is impeding progress and preventing the industry from flourishing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quite simply, without guaranteed in-country connectivity, IoT business cases become untenable, and projects cannot scale. There is an unacceptable level of uncertainty and risk around initial and lifetime device connectivity that many fledgling IoT businesses are not equipped to weather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When an IoT device is connected to a network outside its home country for more than 90 days, it is deemed by MNOs to be &lsquo;permanently roaming&rsquo; and more often than not this will lead to disconnection from the network. For global enterprise IoT deployments this has considerable implications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly, permanent roaming is becoming the status quo given that commercial models for inbound roaming are not as attractive for the mobile network operators (MNOs). But 80% of roaming agreements between operators do not support both&nbsp;PSM (Power Saving Mode)&nbsp;and eDRX[DL1]&nbsp;, (and Extended Discontinuous Reception), both of which are essential for battery life management in IoT devices connecting locally to a network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly, &lsquo;roaming data&rsquo; must be backhauled and these data routing architectures cause network capacity, latency, and performance issues, which is unacceptable for most IoT applications and inevitably leads to poor application performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, commercial disputes between MNOs over roaming agreements, which often occur at short notice, can result in the termination of connectivity agreements between the parties and therefore loss of connectivity for enterprise IoT devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, countries such as Australia, the United States, China, Canada, India, Turkey, and Singapore have introduced restrictions and, in some cases, outright bans on permanent roaming, meaning any IoT deployments at scale will be affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This backdrop of stifling limitations on the IoT market is limiting progress and threatening its very future. Therefore, what potential alternatives are available to help global IoT business circumnavigate these restrictions?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Achieving true global IoT deployment through an intelligent eSIM and network localisation&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Next generation, intelligent eSIM and network localisation solutions (which utilise localisation agreements and network interconnects with regional operators)&nbsp;permit an opportunity for global IoT deployments to sidestep the aforementioned roaming restrictions and to achieve seamless global connectivity without compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vision for eSIM allows the user to use any operator&rsquo;s credentials in order to access their data services. This flexible over-the-air solution enables SIM localisation and a greater choice of roaming partners. Projects can thus be launched using a plug-and-play approach where the SIM card is concerned. With eSIM localisation, permanent roaming challenges are eliminated and application performance improved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further, the business case for MNOs is compelling, with localised eSIM connections generating up to five times more revenue per device for the regional MNO operators. This not only supports IoT business but holds considerable benefit for global MNOs also. It&rsquo;s a win-win situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Multi-IMSI eSIM&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Where eSIM solutions rely on a single global SIM and bootstrap option and are unable to offer the long-term flexibility to deliver high levels of global connectivity at all times; new technology platforms such as&nbsp;multi-IMSI eSIM&nbsp;are enablingadvanced eUICC profile management that is completely agnostic and can store up to 10 bootstrap profiles at any time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eUICC standard significantly improves device uptime and service quality whilst maintaining fall back connectivity.&nbsp;And these profiles can be easily uploaded over-the-air, enabling seamless switching between MNOs to deliver optimum connection levels for global IoT deployments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is enabling more comprehensive, reliable connectivity for the global IoT ecosystem, across a greater number of territories, than any other provider can deliver, as well as eliminating the cost and risk of devices being disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all of this said, the present eSIM ecosystem limits customer choice due to a cumbersome implementation to switch between operators and thus far, this has led to low usage of eSIM, despite its promise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The future growth of the IoT market now lies in guaranteeing global connectivity for commercial IoT devices without compromise and regardless of where they are deployed. And this is especially the case for crucial applications in telehealth or telecare, where personal health depends on sustained and reliable connectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uncertainty about both initial and lifetime device connectivity is a huge concern for businesses rolling out large-scale IoT projects. Global rollouts are not cheap, and the level of investment needed is harder to justify in commercial terms when the connectivity environment is not assured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation will continue to stifle the enormous potential of IoT unless an alternative, such as advanced intelligent eSIMs supported by a network localisation capability, is adopted. It is now for IoT vendors and the global MNO community to come together to simplify the IoT ecosystems and&nbsp;enable the vast promise of IoT to achieve its potential.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>94:T1585,<p>In recent years AI (Artificial Intelligence) has evolved quickly, and it is gradually becoming part of our daily lives. Artificial Intelligence like Google Assistant and Siri are just two of the many types of AI out there that people use in their daily lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gambling industry has changed in the last few decades. Instead of placing a bet in traditional bookies or going to a land-based casino to enjoy an evening playing a slot machine, people have been playing online instead. The revenue generated on the internet through these websites is one of the reasons why the most powerful people in the industry are not afraid of change. Due to modern technology, the gambling industry is booming, so most people involved are welcoming AI with open arms.</p>

<p>Since the first day gambling became available on the web, online bookies and casinos&rsquo; main priority was and still is to eliminate cheating from their games. Although cheating online is difficult, especially in comparison to land-based casinos, it is still possible, and many cybercriminals have taken advantage. People have developed machines known as bots so that they can cheat in casino games like online slots. However, most online casinos have developed and implemented their own AI systems so they can recognize when a bot is being used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online poker is one of the most popular online card games played on the internet. Often players use AI software to help them with statistics or to help coach them while they play. Although some casinos allow users to run these systems while playing poker online, others don&rsquo;t. Similar to online slots, casinos have developed systems so it can see when one of the players is using one of these programs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>AI can be used to Improve a Casinos Customer Service</h2>

<p>A lot of gambling companies have already implemented AI to help manage their customer service. However, it is expected that the use of AI in the customer service area will increase over the next few years. If you work in this area currently, perhaps it&rsquo;s time to worry, because experts believe that approximately 85% of customer service support will be controlled by AI in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most online casinos offer their service 24 hours a day, so providing customer service around the clock can prove challenging. Most well-established casinos and bookmakers have a live chat option. If a customer has any queries or complaints, they can send messages online and expect to get a reply in a matter of minutes. If you have ever used this service and thought you were talking to another human being, the chances are you were chatting with AI technology. You can expect to have less human contact with other humans in the future. This does not only apply to online casinos but to customer services in any industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oracle found that 78% of businesses worldwide are using AI in their customer service. Although this statistic is expected to increase, they have to be fully confident that&nbsp;AI functions&nbsp;properly before implementing it. Customer service is a vital part of any business, and if customers find the system in place frustrating, then the online casino could lose a lot of business.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>AI will be used to Target Punters</h2>

<p>Unlike traditional casinos, most online casino operators have a lot of promotions and offer in an attempt to lure new customers in or to encourage existing customers to gamble. However, AI is expected to change the way these promotions are advertised in the future. AI will target people who it feels will want to take advantage of certain bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some punters are put off by these promotions because they might have a wagering requirement. Casino operators feel that AI can be used to tweak these offers to make them more appealing to certain people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although many sites use cookies so they can understand what their visitors are looking for, AI is expected to take this to the next level. AI will be implemented to analyze different customers&rsquo; behavior, and they can use this information collected to target specific people.</p>

<h2>VR will change the way we Game Live</h2>

<p>Although VR (Virtual Reality) and AI are different from each other, they are closely linked. People are already using VR headsets for many reasons, and experts involved in the casino sector claim that they can be used to make online gambling even more realistic. It could completely revolutionize the way we gamble today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although most online gambling sites provide their guests with far better offers and odds in comparison to land-based casinos, some people still opt to go to the traditional casino instead. However, developers have been creating software that makes people feel that they are in a real-life casino. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, online gambling has increased to new levels, however, many feel it&rsquo;s not the same without the atmosphere. VR could provide this, which would bring gambling at home much more exciting.&nbsp;<br />
It would completely change games like online poker. You would be able to see your opponent&rsquo;s reaction in the middle of games. Imagine a roulette table with a big crowd around you cheering you on before you make your move. Although this situation is common in Hollywood movies, it rarely happens in real life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>95:T12f8,<p>SaaS (software as a service) is not a new term and has shown continued adoption and growth year on year since the term first appeared fifteen years ago, with its commonality and mass adoption only growing over time. With its innate scalability and flexibility, SaaS took advantage of the new public cloud market. Today we find ourselves at a time where SaaS is taking over the cloud computing market and according to Bloomberg, public cloud platforms, business services, and applications (SaaS) will all grow at a&nbsp;9% CAGR&nbsp;(compound annual growth rate) between 2020 and 2023.</p>

<p>COVID has accelerated this mindset: we witnessed an enforced change when remote flexibility and agility moved to the top of the urgency list. Look at the lightning speed of adoption of Zoom, MS Teams and Google Hangouts; the traditional barriers of time, procurement and lengthy evaluations went out of the window.</p>

<p>As a cloud advocate myself, I have been closely working with a wide range of clients of varying sizes and industry sectors over the past fifteen years and have seen the challenges faced when attempting to standardise and bring consistency to their technology estate. Typically, a SaaS offering fits certain needs, but commonly falls short where traditional on-network needs apply. Thus, organisations compromise by either mixing solutions to meet the objective or through living with limitations of the chosen vendor, be they on premise or SaaS.</p>

<p>For example, in the sphere of data protection, a SaaS solution fits well for distributed data instances such as cloud systems, but for a large on premises database you could be facing a longer restore time &ndash; not ideal for those all-important RPO (Recovery Point Objective) or RTO (Recovery Time Objectives) numbers.</p>

<p>We are on an already-proven journey encompassing a hybrid and multi cloud world. Organisations are on a journey of transformation with applications and data residing in a mixed local device, centralised on network and in the cloud environment &ndash; combining new tech with an existing stack. The decision for a new data protection solution today needs to acknowledge and encompass all of these options effectively.</p>

<p>Vendors who acknowledge and support customers in this journey rather than addressing singular camps will become go-to partners, and essential solutions.</p>

<p>From the edge, to the cloud, to the data centre&hellip;</p>

<p>It is this understanding and customer focus that has led to Commvault&rsquo;s recent innovations (and some might say reinvention) in the data protection space. Commvault was one of the first vendors to understand that the market is moving towards SaaS, (IDC now reports that DPaaS is the fastest growing segment in the market) as they launched their SaaS data protection portfolio Metallic in 2019. In the last 12 months, Metallic&rsquo;s pace of innovation and geographical expansion has accelerated &ndash; the benefits of being part of a company that has been a leader in data protection for the past 25 years.</p>

<p>Customers benefit from what Commvault calls &ldquo;the power of AND&rdquo;. This meaning a solution set that addresses the data spread in existence at most organisations from cloud applications, remote devices and importantly addressing the need to encompass legacy on premise data, even in volume! So, you can opt for one vendor that enables you to manage and protect your data stores across all the key variants in the most appropriate manner for each, whilst retaining one holistic, unified view.</p>

<p>An enterprise is now able to backup large on-premise data stores alongside in the cloud data from a flexible delivery model offered from appliance with Hyperscale X, Metallic SaaS or as a managed service gives the customer the best of all worlds. Metallic&rsquo;s unique architecture provides all the benefits of SaaS, but by leveraging an on-premises storage target to back up and recover from, it eliminates any issues of poor performance &ndash; flexibility at scale.</p>

<p>Commvault&rsquo;s close partnership with Microsoft leverages a powerful message to the market, with broad singular coverage for your data in Office 365, wmail, MS Teams, OneDrive, Project, Exchange, SharePoint, SQL and Active Directory. Adding to this is their announced further expansion of the Metallic SaaS portfolio to include all new Metallic Dynamics 365 Backup. With&nbsp;Metallic Dynamics 365 Backup, the Metallic portfolio now supports all three Microsoft clouds: Dynamics, Office 365, and Azure. All on top of wider support including Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft and SAP data stores. Commvault is accelerating its innovation, delivering enterprise-grade software-as-a-service (SaaS) to customers of all sizes across their core data platforms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>96:T82e,<p>The Long March 2 rocket will carry the first crew to a new space station in China.</p>

<p>The first crew of China&rsquo;s new space station prepared to explode this week for the latest steps in Beijing&rsquo;s ambitious program to establish itself as a space power. The mission is China&#39;s first crewed spaceflight in nearly five years, and a matter of prestige for the government as it prepares to mark the 100th birthday of the ruling Communist Party on July 1 with a propaganda blitz.</p>

<p>According to the experts, the Long March 2 rocket carrying three astronauts on the Shenzhou 12 spacecraft will take off from a base in the Gobi Desert in northwestern China on Thursday. They plan to spend three months on the Tiangong station, China&#39;s longest crewed space mission to date, with spacewalks among their jobs.</p>

<p>The astronauts will aim to &ldquo;get their new home in space kitted out and ready to use&rdquo;, said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a practical goal rather than a groundbreaking one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Long March rocket, with the Shenzhou craft attached, was moved to the launchpad at the Jiuquan satellite launch centre last week, according to the Chinese space agency.</p>

<p>Shenzhou 12 will dock with the main section of Tengu Station, Tengu, which was placed in orbit on April 29th. Last month the cargo ship transported fuel, food and equipment for crew missions.</p>

<p>The first Tianhe crew will be all male, though women will be part of future crews on the station, according to Yang Liwei, who orbited Earth in China&rsquo;s first crewed mission in 2003 and is now an official at the space agency.</p>

<p>The Tianhe builds on experience China gained from operating two experimental space stations earlier in its increasingly ambitious space program. Chinese astronauts spent 33 days living on the second of the previous stations, carried out a spacewalk and taught science classes that were beamed down to students across the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>97:T10db,<p><strong>1. Consider your data cap</strong></p>

<p>Data caps are one of the biggest culprits of slow internet speeds out there. ISPs don&rsquo;t advertise their data caps for obvious reasons, but they can seriously mess with your connection.</p>

<p>Data cap means you can use a certain amount of data every month&mdash;anything from a couple hundred megabytes to hundreds of gigabytes. If you exceed your data limit, your ISP will seriously restrict your internet speeds. And you&rsquo;ll notice.</p>

<p><strong>2. Turn things off and on again.</strong></p>

<p>Do it to your router, Do it with the devices you have connected to Wi-Fi. Everything needs a break once in a while&mdash;but especially your router.</p>

<p>&nbsp;urning your networking equipment off and on again can really give your network a boost. We recommend rebooting your equipment regularly&mdash;at least once every few months.</p>

<p><strong>3. Block those ads</strong></p>

<p>Almost every content provider displays advertisements. Everywhere you go online there are endless ads, pictures, GIFs, and auto-played videos.</p>

<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t mind watching/seeing advertisements, your internet connection does. Ad media slows down your internet connection, so sometimes it&rsquo;s easiest to just block them. Install an ad-blocking plugin that will shut down those data-heavy auto-play videos, and you&rsquo;ll free up some breathing room for your connection.</p>

<p><strong>4. Use 5GHz and band steering</strong></p>

<p>The 5GHz band offers many more channels than 2.4GHz so it makes sense to use dual-band APs that support 5GHz as well. This allows older Wi-Fi devices to connect in the lower band and newer dual-band devices to connect via the higher band. Less congestion in the lower band generally means faster connections, and devices in the higher band typically support higher data rates, both of which help to decrease the airtime of devices. Although not all new Wi-Fi devices are dual-band, more and more are these days, especially higher-end smartphones and tablets.</p>

<p>In addition to supporting 5GHz, consider using any band-steering functionality provided by the APs. This can encourage or force dual-band devices to connect to the higher band instead of leaving it up to the device or user.</p>

<p>Many APs only allow you to enable or disable band steering, while some also allow you to configure signal thresholds, so dual-band devices that would have a stronger signal on 2.4GHz aren&#39;t forced to use 5GHz. This is helpful because 5GHz offers a shorter range than the lower band. If your AP supports it, try using the signal-threshold setting, which provides a good compromise between reducing congestion on 2.4GHz while offering users the best signal.</p>

<p><strong>5. Use WPA2 and/or WPA3</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not a secret that WEP security is insecure, even though virtually all APs still support it. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is more secure, but it depends upon the version used. Keep in mind, when using the first version of WPA, data rates on the wireless network are limited to 54Mbps, the maximum rate of the old 802.11a and 802.11g standards. To ensure you can take advantage of the higher data rates offered by newer devices, use only WPA2 and/or WPA3 security.</p>

<p><strong>6. Upgrade to faster internet.</strong></p>

<p>While we hope these tips will do the trick for you, sometimes your internet connection is simply too slow to sustain your internet consumption. If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll need to upgrade to a faster internet plan to get better Wi-Fi speeds.</p>

<p><strong>7. Install Virus and Malware Removal Tools</strong></p>

<p>we highly recommend installing an antivirus- and malware-scanning software. It&rsquo;s probably obvious that any viruses or malware lurking on your computer will put a major drag on your internet speed. Plus, you should have protection software installed as a general rule anyway.</p>

<p>Once you have some good software on board, set it to scan for viruses and malware automatically on a regular basis. If the software does find existing viruses or malware (hence your slow internet speeds), get it removed by a computer technician and get back to easy browsing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>98:Tcc6,<p><a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/">Verizon Business</a>&nbsp;is taking its IoT connectivity global with coverage in 170 countries around the world.</p>

<p>The operator&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://thingspace.verizon.com/">ThingSpace</a>&nbsp;solution aims to provide all the tools needed to prototype, test, connect and manage IoT devices on Verizon&rsquo;s network.</p>

<p>Permanent roaming options are now available across North America and Western Europe all on a single SIM&mdash;providing enterprises with the flexibility they need to monitor a wide array of IoT devices.</p>

<p><strong>Changes the way businesses work</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tami Erwin</strong>, <strong>CEO</strong> at <strong>Verizon Business</strong>, said: &ldquo;The IoT connectivity is changing the way businesses monitor devices and increasing the strategic business value of the data collected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The number of IoT devices is growing exponentially, he noted, and organizations prefer to align with a trusted technology partner who can offer the technical expertise and geo-scale they require.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our global IoT connectivity services are all underpinned by Verizon&rsquo;s years of expertise and industry-leading ThingSpace platform, not to mention a path to evolving into 5G Massive IoT,&rdquo; Erwin added.</p>

<p>Permanent roaming options are now available across North America and Western Europe all on a single SIM&mdash;providing enterprises with the flexibility they need to monitor a wide array of IoT devices.</p>

<p><strong>152,200 IoT devices</strong></p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<a href="https://idc-cema.com/dwn/SF_177701/driving_the_digital_agenda_requires_strategic_architecture_rosen_idc.pdf">IDC</a>, the premium global market intelligence firm, estimates that around 152,200 IoT devices will connect every minute by 2025, while enterprises can deploy IoT devices with permanent roaming across the UK, Canada, and over 10 European markets.</p>

<p>Verizon&rsquo;s IoT device connectivity operates via a best of breed partner ecosystem and is available globally to US multinational companies with fixed or mobile connectivity requirements. Organizations can deploy devices with permanent roaming across Canada, the UK and more than 10 European markets.</p>

<p>Erwin said during Verizon&rsquo;s March investment day that it&rsquo;s starting to see the benefit of industrial IoT investments, adding 10 million incremental machine-to-machine LTE connected devices in 2020 and delivering double-digit connections and revenue growth.</p>

<p>This year, Verizon expects to see continued growth as it scales its IoT practice and installs devices supporting the evolution from 4G to 5G.</p>

<p>With the pandemic, Verizon is seeing unique demand in areas like DIY connected alarm systems and cross-border asset tracking, a representative said. Over the next few years, analysts at IDC estimate that 150,000+ IoT devices will connect every minute.</p>

<p>A big motivator for Verizon in the global IoT sector appears to be rival AT&amp;T, which spent years developing its IoT connectivity business and has offered global IoT services for a long time, including with many major car companies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>99:T1601,<p><strong>What is Cloud Computing?</strong></p>

<p>A Cloud is simply a term that is used to describe a network of computers operating programs and applications that run on connected servers instead of a local machine. Cloud computing can be considered as a Virtual Hosting Solution. It is a set up whereby software, data storage, and processing power are provided from a decentralized, remote location. All information files and application programs are hosted on a global network of remote data centers, facilitating sharing and collaboration regardless of the user location or the access device being used. In simple terms, cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources over the internet. These resources can be servers, databases, software, networking, analytics, and/or intelligence.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Types of Cloud Computing</strong></p>

<p>There are different models of cloud computing, and a single model is not fit for all. As per business nature, several different models, types, and services have evolved. To avail your cloud services optimally, it is essential to determine your cloud computing architecture.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Types of Cloud Services</strong></p>

<p>There are three different deployment types of cloud services. They are:</p>

<p><strong>1. Public Cloud</strong></p>

<p>Third-party cloud service providers own these. Their computing resources, such as the server and storage, are delivered over the Internet. Here all the resources such as the hardware, software, and supporting infrastructure are owned by the cloud provider. You can access these services and manage your account via the web browser. It follows a multi-tenant architecture with a pay-as-you-go pricing model. The top vendors of public clouds are AWS, MS Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p><strong>2. Private Cloud</strong></p>

<p>This refers to the cloud computing resources that are exclusively used by a single business or an organization. A private cloud can be located in an organization&rsquo;s on-site data center. The services and infrastructure in a cloud are maintained over a private network. It follows a single-tenant architecture with on-premise hardware with direct control of underlying cloud infrastructure. The top vendors for private clouds are HPE, VMware, Dell EMC, IBM, Red Hat, Microsoft, OpenStack.</p>

<p><strong>3. Hybrid Cloud</strong></p>

<p>As the name suggests, hybrid clouds combine third-party, public fog, and on-premise private clouds. Here the data and applications can be moved between public and private clouds. A hybrid cloud provides more flexibility, more deployment options, and optimizes the existing infrastructure, security, and compliance for business. It has cloud bursting capabilities with the benefits of both public and private cloud environments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, as per your business nature, several different deployment models, types, and services have evolved.</p>

<p><strong>Service types of the Cloud</strong></p>

<p><strong>Let us review the different service types of the cloud.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. IaaS [Infrastructure as a Service]</strong></p>

<p>It is a computing and infrastructure service which is provisioned and managed over the Internet. IaaS can be scaled up and down as per requirement. It avoids the capital investment required for buying and managing physical servers and other infrastructure. The cloud computing service provider manages and the infrastructure, software, operating system&rsquo;s middleware, and applications while you rent and use the required service component.</p>

<p><strong>2. PaaS [Platform as a Service]</strong></p>

<p>It is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. You can purchase resources from the cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis. PaaS includes IaaS, middleware, development tools, BI services, database management systems, and more. It eliminates the hassle of buying expensive software licenses and orchestrating them. Once you are subscribed, all of it is managed by the cloud service provider.</p>

<p><strong>3. SaaS [Software as a Service]</strong></p>

<p>SaaS provides a complete software solution that you can purchase on a pay-as-you-go basis. It allows a user to connect to and use cloud-based applications over the internet. The leased software and hardware are managed with appropriate SLAs [Service Level Agreements] by the cloud service provider.</p>

<p><strong>4. Serverless Computing</strong></p>

<p>Serverless Computing enables developers to build applications faster and eliminates the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. It is so-called because the tasks associated with the infrastructure provisioning and management are carried out by the cloud service provider. This increases developers&#39; focus on business logic and innovation, increases productivity and optimizes their resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Uses of cloud computing&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don&rsquo;t realise it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations&mdash;from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits&mdash;are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>9a:T9c2,<p>Users with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-microsoft-teams-how-it-works-tips-and-tricks-and-best-alternatives" target="_blank">Microsoft Teams</a>&nbsp;Free accounts have been reassured that their profiles will not be deleted after a number of customers raised the alarm after receiving an email from the company.</p>

<p>Some Microsoft Teams Free admins reported receiving emails last month from the company stating that they had reached the end of a trial period, and that their accounts would be deleted if they did not now pay for a full subscription.</p>

<p>But Microsoft has now said that the email was sent in error, and no users will have their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-video-conferencing-software" target="_blank">video conferencing</a>&nbsp;accounts deleted.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Users Free</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;If you don&#39;t purchase a new subscription by May 3, 2021, your trial data will be available to all people in your organization for about 30 days. At that time, the subscription status changes to Disabled, and only admins will have access to trial data for about another 90 days. After that, your trial is permanently deleted,&quot;</p>

<p>This new policy should only have affected organizations that did not have any sign-ins either during that period, as well as the grace period after the 90 days (120 days in total), before eventually being deleted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However Microsoft was quick to respond, with a senior Microsoft Teams project manager taking to the company&#39;s Tech Community forum to straighten out the issue.</p>

<p>Sam Cosby from the Customer Experience &amp; Obsession side for Teams Free Organizations within the Teams Engineering Team at Microsoft, noted that the issue began back in January of 2021, when the company implemented a new method to help reduce the number of Teams Free organizations that go unused over a 90-day period of inactivity by deleting them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>9b:T6c6,<p>Nokia has launch of its Marketplace of Data. A Blockchain-type service giving real time providing to massive trusted data set.</p>

<h1>Nokia Said:-</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Our customer need secure and trusted assess to data for effective decision making.</li>
	<li>Nokia data marketplace, enterprises and CSPs can now benefit from <em>richer insights and predictive models to drive digital ways of working and tap into new revenue streams.&rdquo;</em></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Data Marketplace facilitates the sharing of data and AI models between enterprises and communications service providers (CSPs).</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The platform also enables the monetisation of data exchanges between customers or business ecosystem participants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This reduces waiting time for shipping participants in the marine ecosystem, enables faster turnaround for ships, and reduces our costs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After losing their early association with cryptocurrencies, blockchains are now finding increasing real-world adoption in enterprises around the world as powerful digital ledgers which provide trust and security.</p>

<p>Justin van der Lande, Principal Analyst at Analysys Mason, commented: &ldquo;Data is the energy needed to run all future business; critical to their success in creating the best AI-based insights and needs access to the largest data sets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Data sharing between enterprise partners is vital in building complete data sets. Facilitating data sharing using a secure platform, such as Nokia&rsquo;s blockchain-based Data Marketplace, accelerates enterprises&rsquo; building of new data sets and creates richer business partnerships for them.&rdquo;</p>9c:Tdd9,<p>Big data is no longer a fancy term for businesses, as they are keenly embracing it to ramp up different processes and operations. You can follow customer data to improve marketing strategies, while industrial analytics can help with predictive maintenance of equipmentSurprisingly, big data and analytics can also empower human resource management in more than one way. Here are some reasons to consider integrating the technology in your HR operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Better hiring decisions</strong></p>

<p>As the job market gets more competitive,it gets harder for companies to attract the most talented professionals. Moreover, it is easy to make bad&nbsp;hiring decisions&nbsp;when you are stressed. Data science can help you take a more scientific approach to talent acquisition, as it lets you filter through resumes and pick only the most promising prospects. You end up doing fewer rounds and interviews yet have better chances of onboarding only the right people who deliver real value.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden talent insights</strong></p>

<p>Organizations often overlook the talent they already have within their team and waste time and money to hire external talent.&nbsp;Big data&nbsp;can help you unlock hidden talent insights and save the efforts. You can combine it with Natural Language Processing to analyze project reviews, manager feedbacks, and the overall talent profile of the existing team. It helps in building skill profiles of current employees for better workforce planning and working with optimal resources.</p>

<p><strong>Unbiased HR decisions</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Human resource management is a complex process because it involves many decisions, such as the ones related to demographics, environment, training, engagement, retention, and health and safety of employees. Smaller organizations can find it hard to handle such a lot of work, so availing the services of a professional employer organization (PEO) makes sense. You can&nbsp;learn about PE<em>O services&nbsp;and the technology they offer to empower your core HR processes. They can leverage big data to help your business with unbiased HR decisions that deliver extensive benefits to your business.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p><strong>Employee performance tracking</strong><em> </em></p>

<p><em>Tracking the performance of your employees can be a <span class="marker">big headache</span>. It is even more challenging if you have a large team with hundreds or thousands on board. The use of Big Data brings efficiency and accuracy to the entire process. The system helps with tracking and monitoring KPIs in real-time and evaluating workers separately. You can even use it to detect potential flaws in work </em>and prevent them even before they happen.</p>

<p><strong>Enhanced retention</strong></p>

<p>Embracing the big data in HR gives you the benefit of enhanced retention. Making people stay gives you dual benefits, as it boosts the growth of the business and strengthens your reputation as an employer. Employees&nbsp;stick with a company&nbsp;when they are happy with their salary, growth, and overall culture. Data science helps you stay a step ahead on employee outlook towards all these factors. You can take the right steps at the right time to boost satisfaction and ensure long-term retention.&nbsp; Big data and analytics can go a long way in making your HR operations more efficient. It helps you make better decisions to build a smarter and happier team that stays with the business for the long haul.</p>9d:T120b,<p>The world of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance to successfully respond to the great challenge it faces in the 21st century: to achieve a General Artificial Intelligence (AGI), that is, one that is capable of learning intellectual tasks as humans do.</p>

<p>In June 2020, the Californian company OpenAI announced&nbsp;GPT-2&#39;s upgrade to GPT-3 , a language model based on artificial intelligence and deep learning with cognitive capabilities. It is a&nbsp;technology that has generated great expectations&nbsp;and that has been presented as the most important and useful advance in AI in recent years.</p>

<p><strong><ins>OpenAI</ins></strong>&nbsp;is a non-profit company founded by&nbsp;Elon Musk, co-founder and director of Tesla and SpaceX, which was born with the aim of researching and democratizing access to General Artificial Intelligence. Originally, it was a non-profit organization. However, in 2020, it became&nbsp;a company and&nbsp;partnered with Microsoft in order to achieve new advances, both in the field of language with GPT-3 models, and in the field of robotics and vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><ins>GPT-3</ins></strong>&nbsp;(Generative Pre-Training Transformer 3) is what is known as an autoregressive language model, which uses deep learning to produce texts that simulate human writing.</p>

<p>Unlike most artificial intelligence systems that are designed for a use case, this API (Application Programming Interface) provides a general-purpose &quot;text input and output&quot; interface, allowing users to test it. in practically any assignment in English.&nbsp;This tool&nbsp;is capable of, among other functions, generating a text on any subject that is proposed to it in the same way as a human would, programming (in HTML code) and generating ideas.</p>

<p>As&nbsp; Nerea Luis , an expert&nbsp;in artificial intelligence and engineer at Sngular, says, &ldquo;GPT-3 is living confirmation that the Natural Language Processing area is advancing more than ever by leaps and bounds.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;GPT-3 has aroused a lot of interest because it is one of the first systems to show the possibilities of general artificial intelligence, because it completes with surprisingly reasonable results tasks that until now required a specially built system to solve that particular task.</p>

<p>As for the possible applications that this tool may have, I mention the following:</p>

<p><strong>Generation of different styles of texts</strong></p>

<p>GPT-3 will be able to generate text for websites , social media ads, scripts , etc. In this way, with a few simple guidelines of the needs you have, GPT-3 will transform it into a precise text. In addition, you can select the type of text you need, from the most generic to the most strategic and creative.</p>

<p><strong>Writing e-mails</strong></p>

<p>With GPT-3 you will be able to compose emails (among other functions) by simply giving it some guidelines of what you want to say and communicate. For example, through&nbsp;magicemail.io, a portal where you can test the tool (there is a waiting list of about 6000 users), you can see how it works. As a Google Chrome extension, Magicemail will be installed in our Gmail.</p>

<p>When an email arrives, we will simply have to click on the tool to receive a phrase of what they want to tell us in the email.</p>

<p><strong>Creation of landing pages</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GPT-3 will develop the code just by telling it how we want our landing page or website to look. Once you give us the HTML code, we will only need a &quot;copy and paste&quot; to have an optimal result. The tool will significantly streamline web development processes.</p>

<p><strong>Chatbots</strong>&nbsp; With this model, chatbots will be much more accurate, with more accurate responses, generating in the user a value of more personalized and effective attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, GPT-3 could have huge implications for the way software and applications are developed in the future.</p>

<p>Let us remember that currently the use that is given to the GPT-3 model is mainly limited to the research community. However, it is clear that GPT-3 in the near future may create everything that has a language structure, such as: answering questions, writing essays, summarizing texts, translating, taking notes and even creating code for computers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, GPT-3 is positioned as an artificial intelligence tool with great potential for the future. And, surely, when it is open to the public, its reach will be much more surprising.</p>9e:Td29,<p>The importance of data is growing each day due to the increased use of technology. A&nbsp;<ins>recent study&nbsp;</ins>forecasted that data would grow by 40% within the next decade. Even with the enormous amounts of data, we are still starving for more knowledge.</p>

<p>Data mining is the activity of looking at&nbsp;databases&nbsp;of information to generate new information. It is not the process of extracting data but about extrapolating patterns and new information from collected data.</p>

<p>The process is not simple since very few&nbsp;<em><ins>data mining techniques</ins></em>&nbsp;to acquire information from a large data set is available. One requires powerful tools to help them get the right information. It is impossible to do it without effective data mining tools.</p>

<p><strong>The Main Data Mining Techniques</strong></p>

<p>The choice of picking a certain data mining technique depends on the problem you need to solve. Different problems require different approaches. It is vital to pick the most appropriate technique to yield better results.</p>

<p>Below are the main data mining processes to help you achieve the required results;</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>&nbsp;Association rule learning</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em><ins>This process</ins></em>&nbsp;helps one identify the relationship between different variables in huge databases. Using this process, one can unpack various hidden patterns in a large data set to identify variables frequently in the dataset.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. <strong>Clustering analysis</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;<ins><em>cluster is a</em></ins> collection of data objects. Objects within the same cluster have similar characteristics. This clustering process discovers groups and clusters in the data so that the association between the two objects is high. It is best when creating customer profiling.</p>

<p><strong>3. Regression Analysis</strong></p>

<p>Regression analysis&nbsp;identifies and analyses the relationship among variables. It helps identify and understand the value of changes in the dependent variable when there is a change in the independent variable. Analysts mainly use this technique in prediction and forecasting.</p>

<p><strong>4. Outlier Detection</strong></p>

<p>It is a technique used to identify data items in a database that does not match a known or expected behaviour pattern. One can refer to such data items as novelties, noise, deviations, and exceptions. These are data items that deviate from the common average within a data set or a combination of data. These deviations are a clear indication that something is out of the normal, and one must do more investigation on it. This method is vital in intrusion detection, system health monitoring, and fraud detection.</p>

<p><em><strong>5. Classification Analysis</strong></em></p>

<p>Classification analysis is vital when retrieving important and relevant information from databases. It is a similar process to clustering due to the division of data into different segments. The only difference with clustering is that analysts know the different classes. In classification analysis, one applies algorithms to help in deciding the classification of the data. This process is mainly used in emails to categorize emails into different sections, such as legitimate or spam.</p>9f:Tdd1,<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), in association with cloud security management provider AlgoSec, has done just that in its latest report. The study, &lsquo;State of Cloud Security Concerns, Challenges, and Incidents&rsquo;, polled almost 1,900 IT and security professionals across a variety of organisation sizes and locations. The first clear finding was that organisations continue to move to complex cloud environments. More than half (52%) of respondents said at least two fifths or more of their workloads (41%) were in public cloud environments as of last year. For the rest of 2021, this is predicted to rise to 61%. In terms of specific cloud providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS) just outbids Microsoft Azure with 67% to 65% share. Google Cloud (37%) is a distant third. These figures are not dissimilar trends to the Flexera State of the Cloud 2021 which was published last month; the needle is still moving to public and multi-cloud. Like the Flexera, security continues to be the top challenge. This may not be too surprising given the report authors, but the data digs deeper into specific concerns. The CSA and AlgoSec study found respondents&rsquo; biggest issues were network security &ndash; cited by 58% of respondents &ndash; and a lack of cloud expertise (47%). One in three respondents (32%) noted there was insufficient staff to manage cloud environments. In total, almost four in five (79%) of those polled reported staff-related issues. The CSA called this &lsquo;notable&rsquo;, and a clear indicator that organisations were struggling with handling cloud deployments and a largely remote workforce. Another interesting comparison with the Flexera benchmark can be found in management. The Flexera report found a wide range of stakeholders managing cloud spend. In the majority of cases, a specific cloud team took charge, but stragglers, such as forecasting cloud costs, saw input from infrastructure and ops, as well as finance. Looking at cloud security, the CSA and AlgoSec data again see a less-than-clear-cut path. 35% of respondents said their security operations team managed cloud security, followed by the cloud team (18%), and IT operations (16%). Yet wider stakeholders, from network operations, to DevOps, and even application owners, were cited. The CSA said this &lsquo;showed confusion.&rsquo; The survey also asked whether organisations had suffered a cloud-related operational incident over the past 12 months. Only one in 10 (11%) said they had, remaining consistent with 2019 figures. Hold the bunting and celebrations, however; two in five (41%) said they were unsure &ndash; a significant uptick on two years previous &ndash; with a full quarter (27%) preferring not to answer. Ultimately, the report&rsquo;s keynote was around a general sense of confusion among organisations. This is not a new sensation &ndash; this publication has reported variously on how complexity breeds confusion &ndash; but cloud security tools which supplement the workforce are now the order of the day. This chimes with the ecosystem John Morgan, CEO at cloud cybersecurity detection provider Confluera, sees. &ldquo;As the gap narrows between cloud adoption and IT resources to secure the cloud or hybrid environment, I expect more organisations to adopt a new class of cloud-based security solutions as they will be required to accelerate business, provide better user experiences, and create new security processes to keep with modern application development practices,&rdquo; Morgan told CloudTech.</p>a0:T727,<p>The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and ISACA have announced the launch of a new cloud auditing and security certificate &ndash; aimed at being the first such &lsquo;global, vendor-neutral, technical credential&rsquo; in the industry. The Certificate of Cloud Auditing Knowlledge (CCAK) aims to &lsquo;fill a gap in the industry for competent technical professionals who can help organisations mitigate risks and optimise ROI in the cloud&rsquo;, as the companies put it. The certification builds upon the already-available CCSK (Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge) from the CSA, and is designed to complement ISACA offerings, such as the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA). CCAK &lsquo;delivers the best possible solution for effective cloud assessment and auditing by preparing IT and security professionals to ensure internal requirements are fulfilled and the right controls are in place&rsquo;, the companies noted. This includes mitigating the risks and costs of auditing management, as well as leading organisations through successful cloud adoption and management while retaining customer trust. The certificiation also includes different areas of technology stacks and deployment frameworks, such as DevOps, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). &ldquo;The introduction of the CCAK is an important milestone in delivering the necessary expertise to enable professionals to objectively evaluate critical cloud assurance issues,&rdquo; said Daniele Catteddu, Cloud Security Alliance chief technology officer. &ldquo;Cloud Security Alliance is proud of our collaboration with ISACA to create this high-quality credential which will be leveraged by individuals, businesses and regulatory bodies around the world to raise the baseline of security, governance and compliance in cloud computing.&rdquo;</p>a1:T6da,<p>When it comes to small businesses and cybercrime, the statistics are frightening. Forty-three percent of all cyber attacks worldwide target small businesses, and 60 percent of small businesses that are victims of a cyber attack go out of business within six months. Cybercrime costs businesses more than $2.2 million every year and, in 2019, there was a 424 percent increase in new small-business cyber breaches. Simply put, the digital world is dangerous for entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>Of course, that&#39;s not going to stop you trying to push your business to the top, so you might as well take some precautions. For instance, the Winston Privacy Filter.</p>

<p>Winston is a plug-and-play device that gives you control over your digital privacy. Unlike VPNs, anti-malware, and other subscription cybersecurity products, with Winston, you only pay once and you&#39;re covered whenever you plug in. Not only does Winston cloak your location and identity from anyone creeping on your network, but it also blocks malware and adult content, filters out ads and trackers, and more. The end result is a cleaner, faster, more secure browsing experience that keeps your small business safe.</p>

<p>Winston works on every device in your home or office, from computers and smart TVs to tablets. You can protect mobile devices with the iOS and Android apps and encrypt your internet to prevent hacks and identity theft. Winston uses smart cloaking to route high-risk traffic over a zero-logging, proprietary distributed Privacy Mesh network, making it extremely difficult for your location and identity to be tracked. Best of all, there are no subscription fees.</p>

<p>Protect your digital life and improve your browsing experience on every device.</p>a2:T113e,<p>Every day, start-ups are becoming increasingly popular. Unlike a regular business, a start-up is innovative in nature as there is no such business prior to it. It usually comprises a young team that has a great idea and an implementation plan on the one hand, and lack of money and resources on the other. Start-ups form the backbone of the economy and significantly contribute to a country&rsquo;s economic goals.</p>

<p>Despite making up nearly 90 percent of all registered businesses, start-ups continue to remain underserved compared to large enterprises. The biggest handicap that these small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) suffer from is that they are yet to fully embrace the latest technologies. The start-ups segment in the cloud market is struggling with its technical and business shortcomings, which have been further exacerbated by the Covid-19 crisis. Reports have shown that a rising number of SMBs are midway in their endeavours to migrate data and applications to the cloud. This will benefit them as they will get more flexibility and agility to scale their business, enhance storage and bandwidth, and reduce costs.</p>

<p>Although several start-ups have migrated to the cloud, their overall journey is devoid of a seamless experience. Surveys reveal that a large number of start-ups encounter roadblocks when navigating the move to the cloud. To succeed in cloud adoption and extract full value from it, start-ups need to overcome these challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges in Cloud-Adoption for Start-ups</strong></p>

<p>Research has shown that over 80 percent of start-ups indicate that they are planning to increase investments in cloud infrastructure in the next 3 to 6 months. However, many of these new businesses have less resources that pose as a barrier to their entry in the competitive cloud market. The cost of sustaining IT infrastructure is a formidable hurdle for many founders.</p>

<p>In addition, the lack of know-how is another unique challenge that SMB founders face because they struggle to keep pace with the evolving technological trends and technical expertise required to manage cloud infrastructure. Security is another cause of concern for many start-ups as they have a hard time implementing the essential security protocols.</p>

<p><strong>How Cloud Computing Can Help Start-Ups</strong></p>

<p>As start-ups continue to adapt themselves to the changing needs presented by the Covid-19 crisis, cloud is expected to remain the backbone of the post-pandemic tech landscape. Start-up founders need to look for innovative ways to reduce their IT infrastructure costs and maintain security of their platform from future threats. Founders and developers, additionally, need to support their employees by training them in cloud computing.</p>

<p>Cloud computing can prove to be a game-changer for start-ups, given the large-scale benefits it offers for their growth. It is easy to use and requires minimum investment making it cost-effective. Businesses do not need any special resources and pay only for the actual usage of services, increasing their investments as and when the company grows. Hence, start-ups can begin with a small budget.</p>

<p>The majority of cloud providers offer a set of services and technologies, which can help start-ups protect their data as it is located on reliable servers that make regular backups. It saves time that goes into provisioning of resources. As the business gets access to resources easily and quickly, the organisation becomes highly flexible. Cloud computing also allows businesses to configure auto-scaling so that their infrastructure can grow or shrink depending on the workload and requirement. With cloud infrastructure, team members of an organisation can access project data anytime irrespective of their location and from any device or operating system. Cloud computing can offer start-ups a monthly subscription service and flexibility to modify technologies to keep up with the growth of business.</p>

<p>Start-ups need to be prepared for all kinds of disasters &ndash; right from tornados to hackers. This can make companies lose their data permanently which can leave them bankrupt. And due to data loss, start-ups can also face a lot of legal problems. But with cloud-based backups, companies needn&rsquo;t worry about losing data as it can be stored in remote locations.</p>a3:T14e5,<p>Cloud computing skills are in high demand among organizations that are looking to operate and maintain the organization&rsquo;s cloud solutions.

The latest chapter in this ongoing saga comes from the <strong><a href="https://www.hbo.com/">HBO </a></strong>&nbsp;documentary titled <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSF0KGsFuI8"><em>Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery</em></a></strong>, which claims to have identified Canadian developer <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/peter-todd-was-unmasked-as-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-now-hes-in-hiding/">Peter Todd</a></strong> as the elusive figure behind Bitcoin. However, Todd vehemently denies these allegations, stating that he is not Satoshi and expressing frustration over how he was portrayed in the film.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Documentary's Claims</strong></h2>
<p>Released on October 8, 2024, <em>Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery</em> explores the origins of Bitcoin and delves into the speculation surrounding its creator's identity. Directed by <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullen_Hoback">Cullen Hoback</a></strong>, known for his previous work on exposing anonymous figures like Q from QAnon, the documentary presents a series of theories and interviews with key figures in the cryptocurrency world. In a climactic confrontation, Hoback suggests that Todd may be Satoshi Nakamoto, leveraging what he describes as compelling evidence from Todd&rsquo;s past interactions in online forums.</p>
<p>Todd's involvement in the documentary was initially seen as an opportunity to discuss Bitcoin's history. However, he claims that he was misled about the film&rsquo;s focus and was unaware that it would center around his potential identity as Satoshi. &ldquo;This was clearly going to be a circus,&rdquo; Todd remarked in an email to <strong><a href="https://www.wired.com/">WIRED</a></strong>, expressing his discontent with how he was drawn into the narrative.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Todd&rsquo;s Response and Safety Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>Since the documentary aired, Todd has faced significant backlash and harassment. He has repeatedly asserted, &ldquo;For the record, I am not Satoshi,&rdquo; emphasizing that Hoback's claims are unfounded and motivated by a desire for publicity. Following the film&rsquo;s release, Todd reported receiving numerous emails from individuals seeking financial assistance, further exacerbating his concerns for personal safety.</p>
<p>The implications of being falsely identified as Satoshi are serious; Todd fears potential threats such as robbery or kidnapping due to the immense wealth attributed to Nakamoto. &ldquo;Falsely claiming that ordinary people of ordinary wealth are extraordinarily rich exposes them to threats like robbery and kidnapping,&rdquo; he stated. As a result of these fears, Todd has reportedly gone into hiding.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Broader Context of Satoshi's Identity</strong></h2>
<p>The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has been a tantalizing mystery since Bitcoin's inception in 2009. Various individuals have been suggested as potential candidates over the years, including Hal Finney, Adam Back, and cryptographer Nick Szabo. Each theory has sparked intense debate but ultimately failed to provide conclusive evidence.</p>
<p>Prior to <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSF0KGsFuI8"><em>Money Electric</em></a></strong>, betting markets had speculated on who might be revealed as Satoshi, with cryptographer Len Sassaman being a notable name until his tragic death in 2011. His widow expressed frustration over persistent theories linking her late husband to Bitcoin&rsquo;s creation, highlighting the invasive nature of public speculation surrounding Satoshi&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Criticism of the Documentary</strong></h2>
<p>Critics of Hoback's documentary have pointed out its lack of rigorous evidence and sensationalist approach. Many in the cryptocurrency community view it as an attempt to capitalize on public intrigue rather than contribute meaningfully to understanding Bitcoin's origins. The documentary abruptly shifts focus towards Todd without providing substantial proof to support its claims.</p>
<p>Hoback argues that identifying Satoshi is crucial given the potential implications for global finance if countries consider adopting Bitcoin as legal tender. He maintains that Todd&rsquo;s denials are part of a larger strategy to mislead investigators. However, this stance has drawn skepticism from many who believe it undermines the integrity of genuine inquiry into Bitcoin&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>As Peter Todd continues to navigate the fallout from <em>Money Electric</em>, the search for Satoshi Nakamoto remains unresolved. The documentary has reignited interest in this enduring mystery but also highlighted the personal toll such speculation can take on those involved. While Hoback stands by his conclusions, many in the cryptocurrency community call for caution against hastily attributing identities without irrefutable evidence.</p>
<p>The allure of uncovering Satoshi&rsquo;s true identity persists, but it is accompanied by ethical considerations regarding privacy and safety for those implicated in this ongoing narrative. As discussions continue and new theories emerge, one thing remains clear: the quest for truth behind Bitcoin&rsquo;s creation is far from over.</p>a6:T1383,<p>In a deeply unsettling incident, the mother of a 14-year-old boy, Sewell Setzer III, is pursuing legal action against <a href="http://character.ai"><strong>Character.AI</strong>,</a> an artificial intelligence chatbot service. Megan Garcia alleges that the platform contributed to her son's tragic suicide after he developed an emotional dependency on a chatbot modeled after <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a></strong> from the popular series <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a></strong>. This lawsuit raises critical questions about the responsibilities of technology companies in safeguarding vulnerable users, particularly minors.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Shift in Behavior</strong></h2>
<p>Sewell began using Character.AI in April 2023, shortly after turning 14. According to Garcia's lawsuit, his behavior changed dramatically within months. Once an active and well-adjusted teenager, he became increasingly withdrawn, leaving his Junior Varsity basketball team and struggling to stay awake in class.</p>
<p>By November, his parents sought professional help, leading to a diagnosis of anxiety and disruptive mood disorder. Despite this intervention, Sewell's mental health continued to deteriorate as he became more engrossed in interactions with the chatbot.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Dangerous Attachment</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/24/us-mother-says-in-lawsuit-that-ai-chatbot-encouraged-sons-suicide"><strong>The </strong></a><strong><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/10/24/us-mother-says-in-lawsuit-that-ai-chatbot-encouraged-sons-suicide">lawsuit</a></strong> details how Sewell's fascination with the AI chatbot escalated into a harmful obsession. He reportedly expressed feelings of love for the character and felt unable to function without it. In a journal entry, he mentioned that both he and the bot experienced depression when apart. This emotional attachment culminated in a tragic exchange on February 28, 2024, when Sewell messaged the chatbot, promising to return home to her. Moments later, he took his own life.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Legal Allegations Against Character.AI</strong></h2>
<p>Garcia's lawsuit accuses Character.AI of several serious charges including negligence, wrongful death, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The suit claims that the company failed to protect Sewell from harmful interactions and did not adequately respond when he expressed suicidal thoughts during chats with the chatbot. It asserts that the creators engineered the platform in a way that exploited young users' vulnerabilities, leading to emotional and sexual exploitation.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Company&rsquo;s Response</strong></h2>
<p>Character.AI has publicly expressed condolences for Sewell's death and emphasized its commitment to user safety. In recent months, the company has implemented new safety measures aimed at protecting younger users from inappropriate content. These measures include pop-up notifications directing users to mental health resources when self-harm or suicidal ideation is detected in conversations. However, these safeguards were not active at the time of Sewell&rsquo;s interactions with the bot.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Implications for AI Technology</strong></h2>
<p>This case highlights broader concerns regarding the ethical implications of AI technologies designed for emotional engagement. Experts warn that while these platforms can provide companionship, they may also exacerbate feelings of isolation and depression among vulnerable users. Many young people may turn to AI chatbots for support instead of seeking help from trusted adults or mental health professionals.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Call for Change</strong></h2>
<p>Megan Garcia hopes her lawsuit will not only seek justice for her son but also prompt significant changes within Character.AI and similar platforms. She aims to prevent other families from experiencing similar tragedies by holding companies accountable for their products' impact on mental health. Her attorney has criticized Character.AI for launching without adequate safety protocols, questioning why it took such a tragedy for necessary changes to be implemented.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The heartbreaking story of Sewell Setzer III serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers associated with AI technologies that engage emotionally vulnerable users. As this lawsuit unfolds, it may pave the way for stricter regulations and increased accountability for tech companies in their treatment of minors online. Megan Garcia&rsquo;s fight is not just about seeking justice for her son; it is about ensuring that no other family has to endure such profound loss due to negligence in the digital age.</p>a7:T141f,<p>Recent research sheds light on the longstanding relationship between carbohydrates and human evolution, suggesting that our affinity for carbs may have roots that extend far beyond the advent of agriculture. A groundbreaking study from the <strong><a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/">University of Buffalo</a></strong>, published in <em>Science</em>, indicates that our ability to digest carbohydrates significantly influenced the development of larger brains, challenging previous assumptions that emphasized meat consumption as the primary driver of cognitive evolution.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Ancient Genetic Insights</strong></h2>
<p>The study focuses on the salivary gene AMY1, which produces amylase, an enzyme crucial for breaking down starches in the mouth. Researchers discovered that human ancestors possessed multiple copies of this gene at least 800,000 years ago, a timeline that predates both agricultural practices and significant human migrations out of Africa.</p>
<p>Co-author <strong><a href="https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/biological-sciences/faculty/faculty-directory/omer-gokcumen.html">Omer Gokcumen</a></strong> highlights that this genetic adaptation occurred before humans diverged from Neanderthals, who also exhibited similar genetic traits. This finding suggests a complex interplay between diet and evolutionary biology, with carbohydrates playing a critical role much earlier than previously acknowledged.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Agricultural Revolution and Gene Duplication</strong></h2>
<p>Interestingly, the research also points to a second wave of gene duplication occurring around 12,000 years ago, coinciding with the dawn of agriculture. This timing raises intriguing questions about how dietary shifts influenced genetic evolution and vice versa. As societies transitioned from hunting and gathering to farming, their carbohydrate intake likely increased, further shaping their genetic makeup and potentially their cognitive capabilities.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Rethinking Dietary Assumptions</strong></h2>
<p>The implications of these findings are profound. Traditionally, it has been believed that a meat-heavy diet was essential for brain development. However, this new research posits that carbohydrates may have provided the necessary energy for our ancestors to develop larger brains. As <strong><a href="https://www.sarahkuta.com/">Sarah Kuta</a></strong> notes in her coverage for <strong><a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/"><em>Smithsonian</em></a></strong>, &ldquo;Perhaps carbs, not meat, gave humans the energy needed for developing bigger brains.&rdquo; This reframing encourages a reevaluation of ancient diets and lifestyles, suggesting that hunter-gatherers might have relied more heavily on carbohydrate-rich foods than previously thought.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Carbohydrates and Cognitive Function</strong></h2>
<p>The connection between carbohydrate consumption and cognitive function is not merely historical; it has significant relevance today. Studies have shown that diets high in refined carbohydrates can lead to neurocognitive deficits across various life stages. The brain requires a steady supply of glucose for optimal function, particularly during critical developmental periods such as infancy and childhood. Insufficient carbohydrate intake can compromise cognitive abilities and overall brain health.</p>
<p>Moreover, fluctuations in blood glucose levels due to rapid carbohydrate digestion can adversely affect neurocognitive functions. Stable blood sugar levels are crucial for maintaining cognitive performance over time. This relationship underscores the importance of dietary choices in both historical contexts and contemporary health discussions.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Implications for Modern Diets</strong></h2>
<p>As modern diets increasingly lean towards processed foods high in refined sugars and low in complex carbohydrates, understanding the historical significance of carbs becomes even more pertinent. The potential negative impacts of a high-refined carbohydrate diet on cognitive function highlight the need for balanced nutrition that includes healthier carbohydrate sources.</p>
<p>In light of these findings, public health strategies may benefit from promoting a greater understanding of how traditional diets rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can support not only physical health but also cognitive development.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The recent study from the University of Buffalo offers a fresh perspective on the role of carbohydrates in human evolution. By revealing early genetic adaptations related to carbohydrate digestion, it challenges existing narratives about diet and brain development. As we continue to explore our dietary history, these insights remind us that our love for carbs is deeply embedded in our evolutionary past and potentially vital for our future cognitive health. Understanding this relationship could lead to better dietary practices that honor both our heritage and our health needs today.</p>a8:T1437,<p>As the 2024 presidential election approaches, many Americans are feeling the weight of stress that accompanies such a significant event. A recent survey conducted by the American Psychological Association&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2024/10/top-us-stressors"> (APA)</a></strong> reveals that over 69% of adults in the United States are experiencing heightened anxiety related to the election. This sentiment is echoed across various demographics, highlighting a collective unease about the future of the nation and the potential ramifications of the electoral outcomes.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Understanding the Sources of Stress</strong></h2>
<p>The survey, which included responses from more than 3,300 adults aged 18 and older, indicates that 77% of participants are particularly concerned about the nation's future. The anxiety surrounding this election appears to be more pronounced than in previous years, with many individuals expressing fears about potential violence stemming from election results.</p>
<p>APA CEO <strong><a href="https://www.apa.org/about/apa/senior-staff/evans-bio">Arthur C. Evans</a></strong> noted that over 70% of respondents are worried about election-related violence, while more than half fear that this election could jeopardize democracy itself. Interestingly, these concerns are shared by both Democrats and Republicans, suggesting a rare moment of bipartisan anxiety.</p>
<p>California resident <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6361509/">Andrew Peyton</a></strong> articulated this stress succinctly, stating that the constant barrage of news alerts and political headlines creates an almost omnipresent anxiety. Another Californian, Vanessa Apkenas, reflected on how the political climate over recent years has contributed to her feelings of stress.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Coping Mechanisms for Election-Related Anxiety</strong></h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, there is a silver lining: over 60% of those surveyed maintain a sense of hope regarding potential changes that could arise from the election. Mental health experts suggest several strategies to help individuals manage their stress during this tumultuous time.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Limit Information Intake</strong></h2>
<p>One effective method for coping with election stress is to limit exposure to news and social media. <a href="https://www.doctorsuevarma.com/">Dr. Sue Varma</a>, a psychiatrist, recommends setting timers on social media apps to curb excessive scrolling and notifications. Creating "sacred spaces" during the day&mdash;times when individuals disconnect from their devices&mdash;can foster better mental health and allow for deeper connections with family and friends.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Focus on What You Can Control</strong></h2>
<p>Psychologist Dr. Susan Albers emphasizes the importance of concentrating on aspects of life that are within one&rsquo;s control. This includes maintaining daily routines, engaging in physical activity, and prioritizing self-care practices. By focusing on personal well-being rather than external uncertainties, individuals can mitigate feelings of helplessness associated with the electoral process.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Engage in Positive Political Action</strong></h2>
<p>Engagement in the political process can also serve as a powerful coping mechanism. Dr. Evans suggests that participating in political activities&mdash;whether through volunteering for campaigns or encouraging others to vote&mdash;can provide a sense of agency and empowerment. Taking concrete actions can help alleviate feelings of anxiety by transforming worry into productive efforts.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Building Support Networks</strong></h2>
<p>Establishing a supportive community is crucial during stressful times. Individuals should seek out friends or family members who share similar views or who can offer understanding and empathy. Engaging in open conversations about political concerns can be beneficial, but it&rsquo;s essential to approach these discussions with respect and an open mind.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Professional Help When Needed</strong></h2>
<p>For those whose anxiety becomes overwhelming or interferes with daily functioning, seeking professional help may be necessary. Signs that it might be time to consult a mental health professional include increased isolation or reliance on substances like alcohol to cope with stress.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As Americans prepare for what promises to be a contentious election season, understanding and managing election-related stress is vital for mental well-being. By implementing strategies such as limiting media consumption, focusing on controllable factors, engaging in positive actions, and building supportive networks, individuals can navigate this challenging period more effectively. With hope still prevalent among many voters, it&rsquo;s essential to remember that while elections can be stressful, they also represent an opportunity for change and progress in society.</p>a9:T1226,<p>Renowned film director <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski">Roman Polanski</a></strong>, now 91 years old, has successfully reached a settlement regarding a civil lawsuit that accused him of sexually assaulting a minor in 1973. This development means that Polanski will no longer face trial in Los Angeles, which was originally scheduled for August 2025. According to reports from Agence France-Presse (AFP) and confirmed by his attorney, <strong><a href="https://www.rufuslaw.com/alexander-rufus-isaacs/">Alexander Rufus-Isaacs</a></strong>, the case has been dismissed following the settlement, which was described as satisfactory for both parties involved.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Background on Allegations</strong></h2>
<p>The civil lawsuit was filed in June 2023 by an anonymous plaintiff, referred to in court documents as "<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doe">Jane Doe</a></strong>." The suit alleged that Polanski provided the then-teenager with alcohol during a dinner at a Los Angeles restaurant. Following this, the plaintiff claimed that she became incapacitated and was taken to Polanski's home, where she alleged he sexually assaulted her. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages and was filed just before the expiration of a California law that extended the statute of limitations for claims against sexual offenders.</p>
<p>The allegations resurfaced public scrutiny of Polanski&rsquo;s controversial past. In 1977, he pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old girl, <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3005004/">Samantha Geimer</a></strong>, after which he fled the United States to avoid further legal consequences. Since then, he has lived primarily in France and has faced various allegations of sexual misconduct over the years.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Settlement Details</strong></h2>
<p>The settlement reached this summer led to the formal dismissal of the lawsuit, as confirmed by both parties&rsquo; legal representatives. Gloria Allred, the attorney for the plaintiff, stated that an agreement had been made that satisfied both sides. The specifics of the settlement have not been disclosed, but it effectively ends any potential trial related to these allegations.</p>
<p>This resolution is significant given the ongoing discussions surrounding accountability for historical sexual offenses. The lawsuit was filed shortly before a new California law aimed at allowing victims more time to pursue claims against alleged perpetrators came into effect.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Polanski's Continued Controversy</strong></h2>
<p>Despite his Oscar-winning status for films such as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pianist_(2002_film)"><em>The Pianist</em></a></strong>, Polanski remains a polarizing figure in Hollywood. His past admissions and subsequent flight from justice have led many to view him as a fugitive from U.S. law enforcement. The director's history includes multiple allegations of sexual misconduct from various women, some of whom were minors at the time of their alleged assaults.</p>
<p>Polanski has consistently denied any wrongdoing regarding these allegations and has maintained that he is a victim of circumstance and media scrutiny. His defenders argue that his artistic contributions should not be overshadowed by his past legal troubles.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Public Reaction and Implications</strong></h2>
<p>The resolution of this case continues to evoke mixed reactions from the public and industry professionals alike. Many advocate for survivors of sexual assault and view settlements like this as a necessary step toward justice, while others criticize them as allowing powerful individuals to evade accountability.</p>
<p>The legal landscape surrounding sexual assault claims is evolving, with increased awareness and advocacy leading to more victims coming forward with their stories. This case exemplifies how historical allegations can resurface in contemporary legal contexts, influencing public discourse on accountability and justice for survivors.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>With this latest settlement, Roman Polanski avoids another trial related to serious allegations from his past. While he may have resolved this particular legal challenge, the broader implications of his actions and their impact on victims continue to resonate within society. The conversation surrounding accountability for historical sexual offenses remains vital as more individuals seek justice for their experiences.</p>aa:T1269,<p><a href="https://www.bancosantander.es/"><strong>Banco Santander</strong></a> officially launched its digital banking platform, Openbank, in the United States. This strategic move is aimed at enhancing the bank's auto lending capabilities and expanding its retail footprint in a competitive market. <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tim-wennes">Tim Wennes</a></strong>, CEO of Santander U.S., emphasized that this initiative is pivotal for funding over $30 billion in auto lending assets and improving overall profitability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Horizons in the U.S. Market</strong></p>
<p>Santander stands out as one of the few European banks maintaining a retail presence in the U.S. following the withdrawal of competitors like <strong><a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/">BBVA </a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://group.bnpparibas/en/">BNP Paribas</a></strong>. With more than $45 billion in retail deposits across its 409 branches, primarily located in nine northeastern states, Santander is well-positioned to leverage its existing infrastructure to support Openbank's launch.</p>
<p>Wennes noted that the bank currently has over $60 billion in auto lending assets, much of which is funded through wholesale markets&mdash;an approach that is often more costly than direct funding. By transitioning to a digital banking model, Santander aims to reduce these costs significantly, although specific savings figures were not disclosed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Openbank: A Digital Banking Revolution</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.openbank.es/en"><strong>Openbank</strong></a>, recognized as Europe's largest digital bank with deposits exceeding &euro;18.5 billion (approximately $19.5 billion), represents a significant step in Santander's global strategy to embrace digital banking. The platform is designed to offer a seamless user experience by integrating advanced technology with robust security features. This combination aims to attract customers seeking both high yields and reliable service.</p>
<p>To entice U.S. customers, Openbank is launching with an attractive savings account yield of 5.25%, surpassing offerings from established players like <strong><a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/">Goldman Sachs&rsquo;</a></strong> Marcus and CIT Bank. This competitive rate is part of Santander's broader strategy to capture market share in a landscape dominated by giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Despite its ambitious plans, Santander faces challenges in the U.S. market, particularly regarding profitability. The bank reported a 0.4% year-on-year decline in net profit during the first half of the year due to rising hiring costs and increased provisions for bad loans. The successful rollout of Openbank will be critical for reversing this trend and generating better returns.</p>
<p>Wennes acknowledged the importance of evaluating partnership opportunities to enhance growth within this digital platform. He emphasized that understanding customer needs will be crucial as they navigate this transition toward a fully digital banking experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Investments and Future Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Santander's commitment to expanding its digital capabilities comes at a time when traditional banking models are being challenged by fintech innovations. The bank has already taken steps to streamline operations by hiring former executives from Credit Suisse, aiming to bolster its corporate investment banking sector.</p>
<p>The launch of Openbank is not just about entering the digital space; it's also about creating a sustainable model for future growth. Wennes indicated that leveraging proprietary technology and global expertise will be key components in delivering an exceptional customer experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>As Santander embarks on this new chapter with Openbank, the bank is poised to redefine its presence in the U.S. financial landscape.

This shocking news has sent waves of grief through the music community and his dedicated fanbase worldwide.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Circumstances Surrounding His Death</strong></h2>
<p>Authorities reported that Payne fell from the third floor of the <strong><a href="https://www.casasurhotel.com/en">CasaSur Hotel</a></strong> in the upscale Palermo neighborhood. Emergency services were alerted following reports of an "aggressive man" who appeared to be under the influence of drugs and alcohol. Upon arrival, police found Payne unresponsive in the hotel&rsquo;s courtyard shortly after 5 PM local time. Despite attempts to revive him, he was pronounced dead at the scene due to injuries sustained from the fall.</p>
<p>A distressing 911 call made by a hotel worker revealed that Payne had been causing a disturbance in his room prior to the incident. The worker described a chaotic scene, stating, "When he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone.&rdquo; Local authorities are conducting an investigation into the circumstances leading up to his death, with an autopsy scheduled to determine the exact cause.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Life Remembered</strong></h2>
<p>Payne rose to fame as part of One Direction, which was formed on the British talent show <em>The X Factor</em> in 2010. Alongside fellow members <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/harrystyles/?hl=en">Harry Styles</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/niallhoran/?hl=en">Niall Horan</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/louist91/?hl=en">Louis Tomlinson</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/zayn/?hl=en">Zayn Malik</a></strong>, the group achieved monumental success, selling over 70 million records globally and earning numerous accolades. Their hits like "What Makes You Beautiful" and "Story of My Life" continue to resonate with fans around the world.</p>
<p>After One Direction announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016, Payne pursued a solo career, releasing his debut album <em>LP1</em> in 2019. He collaborated with various artists, including Rita Ora and Charlie Puth, showcasing his versatility and talent beyond boy band fame. His last single, "Teardrop," was released earlier this year.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Fan Vigil and Tributes</strong></h2>
<p>In response to his untimely death, fans gathered outside the CasaSur Hotel to pay their respects. Mourners sang his songs and shared memories of how his music impacted their lives. One fan expressed disbelief at the news, stating, "I feel like it's like a dream... I think it's going to take me a while to accept all this.&rdquo; Many attendees lit candles and left heartfelt tributes at the site where he fell.</p>
<p>Tributes have poured in from fellow musicians and celebrities alike. Simon Cowell, who played a pivotal role in forming One Direction, halted filming for <em>Britain&rsquo;s Got Talent</em> in light of Payne's passing. Other stars have taken to social media to express their sorrow and share fond memories of their time with him.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Struggles with Fame</strong></h2>
<p>Despite his success, Payne had been open about his struggles with mental health and substance use. In past interviews, he discussed how fame often left him feeling isolated and overwhelmed. He once remarked on how easy it was to turn to alcohol while on tour: "Doing a show to however many thousands of people... then being stuck by yourself in a country where you can't go out anywhere &ndash; what else are you going to do? The minibar is always there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His candidness about these issues resonated with many fans who admired his bravery in addressing such personal challenges.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As investigations into his death continue, Liam Payne's legacy as a talented musician and beloved figure remains intact. His contributions to pop music and the impact he had on countless fans will not be forgotten. The music industry mourns not just a star but a young man who brought joy through his artistry.</p>
<p>In these challenging times for his family and friends, support from fans worldwide serves as a testament to Payne&rsquo;s enduring influence.

This surge in earnings reflects not only the bank's strategic maneuvers but also a favorable economic environment that has buoyed the financial sector.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Strong Financial Performance</strong></h2>
<p>On October 15, 2024, Goldman Sachs announced its earnings results, revealing that it generated nearly $13 billion in revenue for the quarter, surpassing projections by over $1 billion. This performance marks a remarkable achievement given the cautious outlook previously expressed by CEO <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_M._Solomon">David M. Solomon</a></strong>. Despite his warnings about potential challenges in various business sectors, Goldman&rsquo;s earnings remained robust, matching the profits from the previous quarter.</p>
<p>An anonymous bank executive attributed this unexpected success to stronger-than-anticipated trading activity in September, coinciding with the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates. The executive noted that while mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) have been sluggish this year&mdash;a crucial revenue source for investment banks&mdash;there is a sense of cautious optimism about the economic landscape. "The world is trending to above average," they stated.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Broader Trends in Banking</strong></h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs is not alone in its positive earnings report; other major banks have also exceeded analyst forecasts. For instance, <strong><a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a></strong> reported a decline in profits of over 10% compared to last year, yet this drop was less severe than analysts had predicted. The bank credited increased trading revenue and investment banking fees for its performance. Similarly, Citigroup announced a smaller-than-expected decline in profits while setting aside significant provisions for future credit card losses.</p>
<p>These results indicate a broader trend among financial institutions as they navigate a challenging economic environment while still managing to deliver solid earnings.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Navigating Political Waters</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to its financial achievements, Goldman Sachs has been mindful of its public image amid the ongoing presidential election cycle. Historically known for its close ties to government officials&mdash;earning it the nickname "Government Sachs"&mdash;the bank has opted to remain neutral during this election season. Concerns arose when Vice President <strong><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/vice-president-harris/">Kamala Harris</a></strong> suggested that Goldman&rsquo;s research supported her economic proposals while criticizing former President Donald Trump&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Goldman clarified that while their analysis indicated Harris's proposals could yield slightly better economic growth, it did not categorically label Trump&rsquo;s plans as detrimental. This careful positioning reflects the bank's desire to avoid political entanglements while navigating a complex economic landscape.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Strategic Shifts in Consumer Banking</strong></h2>
<p>In a notable shift away from consumer banking ambitions, Goldman Sachs has begun divesting from certain credit card partnerships. Recently, the bank sold its General Motors-branded credit cards to Barclays and plans to exit its Apple-branded cards as well. This strategic move comes as Goldman faces challenges within its consumer banking division, evidenced by a significant increase in provisions for credit losses&mdash;totaling $397 million for the last quarter.</p>
<p>This decision aligns with Goldman&rsquo;s broader strategy to focus on its core strengths and reduce exposure to consumer finance risks.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead: Optimism for Dealmaking</strong></h2>
<p>As Goldman Sachs looks forward, there are signs of renewed optimism regarding corporate deal making activities. During a conference call discussing the earnings results, Solomon highlighted pent-up demand among clients as a potential catalyst for increased M&amp;A activity. He noted that lower interest rates and an improving economic outlook could spur more corporate financing opportunities.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the M&amp;A market still has room for growth compared to historical averages, Solomon did not dismiss the possibility of an upcoming "M&amp;A supercycle," suggesting that if demand is released all at once, it could significantly impact market dynamics.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs' strong performance in Q3 2024 underscores the resilience of major banks amid fluctuating economic conditions. With strategic adjustments and an eye on emerging opportunities, the investment bank is poised to navigate future challenges while capitalizing on potential growth areas in both trading and deal making activities. As the financial sector continues to evolve, all eyes will be on how Goldman Sachs adapts and thrives in this complex landscape.</p>ad:T1619,<p>As the week begins, stock futures are exhibiting minimal changes, reflecting a cautious optimism among investors who are eager to see how upcoming corporate earnings will influence market trends. <strong><a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/djia">The Dow Jones </a></strong>&nbsp;Industrial Average futures have dipped by 0.1%, while the S&amp;P 500 index futures have risen by 0.3%. Additionally, <strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/stock-market-today-live-updates.html">Nasdaq-100 futures</a></strong> have gained 0.5%, indicating a mixed sentiment as traders prepare for a crucial earnings week ahead.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Upcoming Earnings Reports</strong></h2>
<p>Investors are particularly focused on the earnings reports scheduled for release this week. Major corporations such as&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/"> Bank of America</a></strong>, Goldman Sachs, and Johnson &amp; Johnson will unveil their latest financial results on Tuesday before the market opens. Following them, <strong><a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/">Morgan Stanley</a></strong> and United Airlines are set to report on Wednesday. Other notable companies like <strong><a href="https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/">Walgreens Boots Alliance</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://in.pg.com/">Procter &amp; Gamble</a></strong> will also share their earnings later in the week.</p>
<p>These reports come on the heels of a strong start to the third-quarter earnings season, initiated by JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, which reported robust profits that helped propel the broader market to new heights last week. The S&amp;P 500 closed above 5,800 for the first time, marking a significant milestone, while the Dow reached its own all-time high.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Current Earnings Performance</strong></h2>
<p>So far, approximately 30 companies within the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://m.economictimes.com/article/markets/stocks/news/sp-500-dow-hit-records-boosted-by-bank-earnings-surprise/articleshow/114163740.cms"> S&amp;P 500</a></strong> have released their quarterly results, surpassing earnings expectations by an average of 5%, according to Bank of America. This performance is an improvement compared to the 3% beat recorded during the previous quarter. However, analysts at Bernstein caution that year-over-year earnings growth for this quarter is expected to be "much lower" than in prior periods.</p>
<p>Despite the recent market gains, investor sentiment remains cautious due to various external factors. The impending presidential election in three weeks adds a layer of uncertainty, alongside rising Treasury yields and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Macro Factors Influencing Market Sentiment</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-crisafulli-68049910a"><strong>Adam Crisafulli</strong></a>, founder of <strong><a href="https://vitalknowledge.net/">Vital Knowledge</a></strong>, highlighted that four major macroeconomic tailwinds&mdash;stimulus measures, resilient economic growth, disinflation trends, and solid corporate performance&mdash;continue to support market optimism. These factors are deemed powerful enough to offset concerns regarding high valuations and geopolitical risks. The S&amp;P 500 has seen an impressive nearly 22% increase this year alone (excluding reinvested dividends), and it recently celebrated two years of bull market conditions since hitting a closing low in October 2022.</p>
<p>However, rising Treasury yields also pose challenges for investors. The benchmark 10-year note yield recently surpassed 4.1%, impacting various sectors from housing to automotive loans.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Economic Data Releases This Week</strong></h2>
<p>In addition to corporate earnings reports, several key economic data points are set to be released this week that could further influence market dynamics. On Thursday, September retail sales and industrial production figures will be published, followed by housing starts and building permits data on Friday.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Amgen Faces Downgrade Ahead of Drug Trial Results</strong></h2>
<p>In a separate development within the biotech sector, <strong><a href="https://www.truist.com/">Truist </a></strong>&nbsp;has downgraded Amgen's stock from buy to hold ahead of anticipated results from its obesity drug trial for MariTide. Analyst <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikripadevarakonda">Srikripa Devarakonda</a></strong> expressed concerns about limited upside potential for Amgen's stock even if trial results prove favorable. He noted that while peak adjusted sales for obesity treatments could reach approximately $5 billion, current valuations already reflect significant value from this program.</p>
<p>Devarakonda adjusted Amgen's price target from $320 to $333 per share&mdash;an increase that remains less than 2% above Friday's closing price.</p>
<p>As investors brace for a pivotal week filled with corporate earnings announcements and critical economic data releases, market sentiment remains a blend of optimism and caution. The outcomes of these reports will likely play a significant role in shaping future market trajectories as traders navigate through both corporate performance metrics and broader economic indicators. With geopolitical tensions and rising yields looming in the background, all eyes will be on how these factors converge in influencing investor behavior in the coming days.</p>ae:T14d8,<p>A recent study reveals that one in four adults in the United States suspects they may have undiagnosed Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder">ADHD</a></strong>). Despite this significant number, only 13% of these individuals have taken the step to discuss their concerns with a healthcare provider. This disparity highlights a troubling gap in awareness and action regarding a condition that affects millions.</p>
<p>ADHD is characterized by symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, impacting daily functioning and quality of life. According to researchers from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768532/"><strong>The Ohio State University</strong>,</a> approximately 4.4% of adults aged 18 to 44 are diagnosed with ADHD. The findings stem from an August survey involving 1,006 adults, shedding light on the prevalence of self-diagnosis in a population that often remains undiagnosed.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Role of Family and Social Influences</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouCWNRvPk20"><strong>Psychologist Justin Barteria</strong></a><strong>n</strong> notes that many adults only recognize their potential ADHD after observing similar symptoms in their children who have been diagnosed. This familial connection underscores the genetic component of ADHD, as it often runs in families. Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-robert-howard-dicker-md-11314655">Robert Dicker</a></strong>, an associate director at&nbsp;<a href="https://zucker.northwell.edu/"><strong> Zucker Hillside Hospital</strong>,</a> supports this notion, stating that parents frequently identify their own struggles with ADHD symptoms after their children receive a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Barterian emphasizes that societal stigma surrounding ADHD can deter individuals from seeking help. Many adults report feeling dismissed in their youth when expressing concerns about their symptoms, leading to a lifetime of unrecognized challenges. This stigma can manifest as negative labels such as "poor student" or "bad kid," further complicating the journey toward diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Stress as a Catalyst for Symptoms</strong></h2>
<p>The relationship between stress and ADHD is complex. Research indicates that stress can exacerbate symptoms of ADHD, creating a vicious cycle where unmanaged stress leads to worsened symptoms, which in turn increases stress levels. Chronic stress is known to cause chemical changes in the brain, particularly affecting areas responsible for executive function&mdash;an area commonly impaired in individuals with ADHD.</p>
<p>Barterian points out that many adults with ADHD experience difficulties with memory and concentration, while children typically exhibit more hyperactive behaviors. This difference can complicate the identification of ADHD in adults, who may not recognize their struggles as symptoms of the disorder.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Impact of Social Media on Self-Diagnosis</strong></h2>
<p>The rise of social media has played a pivotal role in increasing awareness about ADHD symptoms. Videos on platforms like TikTok have led many young people to self-diagnose based on relatable content they encounter online. A 2022 study published in <em>European Psychiatry</em> highlights this trend, noting that discussions surrounding mental health on social media can reduce stigma but may also lead to misdiagnosis without professional evaluation.</p>
<p>Barterian advises those who resonate with these online descriptions to seek formal evaluations from qualified professionals. He stresses the importance of distinguishing between genuine ADHD symptoms and those that may arise from other conditions such as anxiety or depression.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Treatment Options and Coping Strategies</strong></h2>
<p>For those diagnosed with ADHD, various treatment options are available. These include stimulant medications designed to enhance focus and concentration, as well as therapy aimed at developing coping strategies for managing symptoms effectively. Barterian notes that treatments can vary widely depending on individual needs and symptom presentation.</p>
<p>Additionally, lifestyle changes such as establishing routines, practicing mindfulness techniques, and engaging in regular physical activity can help mitigate stress and improve overall functioning for individuals with ADHD.</p>
<p>The findings from this study serve as a crucial reminder of the importance of addressing mental health concerns openly and without stigma. With one-fourth of U.S. adults suspecting undiagnosed ADHD but only a small fraction seeking help, there is an urgent need for increased awareness and education about the disorder.</p>
<p>Encouraging conversations around mental health can empower individuals to seek the support they need while fostering an environment where seeking help is normalized rather than stigmatized. As society continues to evolve in its understanding of mental health, it is vital to ensure that those affected by conditions like ADHD have access to the resources and support necessary for leading fulfilling lives.</p>af:T12ff,<p>In an era where digital presence is paramount, <strong><a href="https://www.bioz.com/">Bioz, Inc</a>.</strong> stands at the forefront of revolutionizing how scientific product suppliers and distributors engage with their audiences.

Central to this transformation is the rise of decentralized finance (<strong><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/decentralized-finance-defi-5113835">DeFi</a></strong>) and <strong><a href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/what-is-web3">Web3 </a></strong>&nbsp;technologies, which aim to dismantle traditional barriers that have long excluded vast populations from essential banking services.</h5>
<h5>As of 2021, around <strong><a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2022/07/21/covid-19-boosted-the-adoption-of-digital-financial-services">1.4 billion</a></strong> people worldwide remain unbanked, lacking access to formal financial systems, while an additional 1 billion are underbanked, facing significant limitations in accessing affordable financial products. This exclusion perpetuates cycles of poverty, restricting individuals' abilities to save, borrow, or invest. However, decentralized technologies utilizing blockchain and smart contracts present a promising avenue for enhancing financial inclusion.</h5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h2><strong>Understanding Web3 Technologies</strong></h2>
<h5>Web3 represents a decentralized iteration of the internet built on blockchain technology. This approach marks a significant departure from conventional centralized financial systems that rely heavily on intermediaries like banks and payment processors. Instead, Web3 facilitates peer-to-peer transactions and automated financial services. For the underbanked population, this shift is revolutionary.</h5>
<h5>Access to digital wallets, decentralized applications (dApps), and cryptocurrencies empowers individuals to store, transfer, and grow their wealth independently of traditional banking institutions. This newfound autonomy helps users avoid hefty fees and geographical restrictions while adhering to regulatory compliance across various jurisdictions.</h5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h2><strong>Key Innovations Driving Financial Inclusion</strong></h2>
<h5>Several industry players are making notable strides towards democratizing finance through innovative Web3 solutions. For instance, Mastercard has partnered with MetaMask and Baanx to introduce a crypto-to-fiat card that enables users to spend their cryptocurrency directly in fiat currency at any merchant accepting Mastercard. This initiative eliminates the need for intermediaries such as exchanges or banks, thereby facilitating easier access for self-custodial wallet users to utilize their funds outside the crypto ecosystem.</h5>
<h5><a href="https://www.crossfit.com/"><strong>CrossFi</strong></a>, founded by <strong><a href="https://ae.linkedin.com/in/amamasidikov/en">Alexander Mamasidikov</a></strong>, is another company championing financial inclusion through Web3 technologies. CrossFi develops DeFi tools designed to democratize access to financial services, allowing users to manage both fiat and cryptocurrency assets seamlessly. The company has introduced the world&rsquo;s first non-custodial payment card that enables users to spend cryptocurrency directly from their Web3 wallets without relying on third-party custodians or exchanges. For millions lacking conventional banking access, this payment card serves as a vital link to the global economy.</h5>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Considerations in Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<h5>As promising as these developments are, they also raise important regulatory considerations. Fintech companies like CrossFi must ensure compliance with local regulations by implementing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks before issuing credit cards. Collaborating closely with local regulators and banking partners is essential for maintaining compliance across all products. Mamasidikov emphasizes that robust compliance frameworks are critical for preventing exploitation within the DeFi space, ensuring trust and sustainability for users.</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Role of Stablecoins and Decentralized Lending</strong></h2>
<h5>Beyond payment solutions, stablecoins and decentralized lending platforms are pivotal in extending financial services to underserved populations. Stablecoins&mdash;digital currencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar&mdash;offer security against the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. They provide an ideal solution for individuals in regions with unstable currencies or inflationary pressures. Additionally, decentralized lending platforms allow users to access credit without needing traditional bank accounts or credit scores, opening new avenues for financial empowerment.</h5>
<h5><a href="https://ch.linkedin.com/in/olga-feldmeier"><strong>Olga Feldmeier</strong></a>, CEO of <strong><a href="https://smartvalor.com/en/">Smart Valor</a></strong>, highlights the transformative potential of DeFi in making essential financial services more accessible. She notes that stablecoins can act as a safeguard for individuals in hyperinflationary environments, enabling them to protect their wealth while participating in the global economy.</h5>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Future of Financial Empowerment</strong></h2>
<h5>The movement towards decentralized finance is still nascent but holds immense potential for creating a more inclusive financial system. By eliminating intermediaries and providing direct access to financial services through innovative Web3 technologies, individuals can gain greater control over their finances regardless of their geographical location. This empowerment not only bridges gaps for the underbanked but also paves the way for a more equitable global economy.</h5>
<h5>Ultimately, the democratization of finance through Web3 transcends mere technological advancement; it embodies the aspiration for a fairer system where everyone has an opportunity to engage meaningfully in the global economy. As we look ahead, it is clear that the future of finance is decentralized&mdash;an inclusive landscape where every individual has a seat at the table.</h5>b1:T129e,<p><strong><a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/travel/lifestyle/humanity-may-have-reached-its-life-expectancy-cap-despite-technological-advances-study-reveals-19489090.htm">Recent research</a> published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/nataging/"><em>Nature Aging</em></a> suggests that humanity may be nearing its upper limit for life expectancy. Despite significant advances in medical technology and genetic research, the overall increases in lifespan appear to be plateauing, particularly in countries known for their long-living populations.</strong></p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Understanding Life Expectancy</strong></h2>
<h4>Life expectancy is defined as the average number of years a newborn is expected to live, assuming current mortality rates remain constant. This metric is crucial for assessing public health but has limitations; it cannot predict sudden changes caused by pandemics or breakthroughs in medical science.</h4>
<h4>The study led by <strong><a href="https://publichealth.uic.edu/profiles/s-jay-olshansky/">S. Jay Olshansky</a></strong> from the <strong><a href="https://www.uic.edu/">University of Illinois-Chicago</a></strong> analyzed life expectancy data from 1990 to 2019, focusing on eight nations with notably high longevity: Australia, France, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, and Switzerland. Notably absent from this elite group is the United States, which was included in the study due to its historical predictions of a dramatic rise in life expectancy this century.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h2><strong>Trends in Longevity</strong></h2>
<h4>The findings indicate that while women generally outlive men and improvements in life expectancy continue, the rate of these improvements is diminishing. In 1990, life expectancy increased by approximately 2.5 years per decade; however, by the 2010s, this figure had dropped to just 1.5 years. In the U.S., improvements have stagnated almost entirely due to various societal issues such as drug overdoses, gun violence, obesity, and healthcare inequities.</h4>
<h4>Researchers also estimated that if all deaths before age 50 were eliminated across these nine regions, the maximum increase in life expectancy would still be a modest 1.5 years. This data raises concerns about the declining relative position of the U.S. compared to other nations.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h2><strong>The Concept of a Longevity Plateau</strong></h2>
<h4>The study posits that there may be a biological limit to human lifespan that we are approaching. According to Olshansky, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re squeezing less and less life out of these life-extending technologies,&rdquo; attributing this stagnation to the complexities of aging itself. While instances of individuals reaching 100 years old are becoming more common&mdash;like former President <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter">Jimmy Carter</a></strong>&mdash;only a small percentage of the population will likely achieve this milestone consistently.</h4>
<h4>In 2019, just over 2% of Americans reached age 100 compared to approximately 5% in Japan and nearly 9% in Hong Kong. Experts suggest that while the number of centenarians may increase due to population growth, the percentage of those reaching such an age will remain limited.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h2><strong>Implications for Society</strong></h2>
<h4>The implications of these findings extend beyond mere statistics; they challenge existing assumptions about retirement age and financial planning for older adults. As life expectancy plateaus, it becomes essential to reconsider how society prepares for an aging population.</h4>
<h4>Mark Hayward from the University of Texas emphasized that while future breakthroughs could potentially enhance longevity, no such advancements are currently on the horizon. He described the study as a valuable contribution to understanding mortality trends and affirmed that we are indeed reaching a plateau in life expectancy.</h4>
<h4>As researchers continue to explore the limits of human lifespan, it is clear that society must adapt to these emerging realities. The notion that advancements will indefinitely extend life may need reevaluation as we confront biological constraints on longevity. Eileen Crimmins from USC echoed this sentiment, highlighting the worrying trend regarding the U.S.'s relative standing in global longevity metrics.</h4>
<h4>In summary, while humanity has made remarkable strides in extending life through technological and medical advancements, recent studies suggest we may be nearing a ceiling for how long we can live. As we grapple with these findings, it becomes increasingly important to reassess our expectations and preparations for aging populations worldwide.</h4>b2:T1233,<h4>On the evening of October 7, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/?hl=en">Taylor Swift</a></strong> made a striking appearance at <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Stadium">Arrowhead Stadium</a></strong>, where she cheered on her boyfriend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/killatrav/?hl=en"><strong>Travis Kelce</strong>,</a> as the Kansas City Chiefs faced off against the New Orleans Saints in a highly anticipated Monday Night Football matchup. Swift&rsquo;s choice of attire was nothing short of spectacular, featuring a plaid, off-the-shoulder minidress paired with bold black knee-high platform boots. However, it was her unique touch of glitter freckles adorning her cheeks and nose that truly set her look apart, adding a playful yet glamorous flair to her ensemble.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Fashion Choices That Turn Heads</strong></h2>
<h4>This isn't the first time Swift has turned heads with her game-day fashion. Just last month, she sported eye-catching blood-red over-the-knee boots along with a denim corset and shorts during a Chiefs game against the Baltimore Ravens. The pop star seems to have embraced a plaid trend recently; earlier this year, she donned a Vivienne Westwood plaid jacket and miniskirt while out in London. At the <strong><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-monday-night-football-style-glitter-freckles-plaid-dress-boots-1235795383/">MTV Video Music Awards</a></strong> in September, she channeled Cher from "Clueless" in a striking yellow plaid Dior corset dress. Fans are left wondering if these repeated plaid choices carry a deeper message.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Family Support at the Game</strong></h2>
<h4>Swift's presence at the game was not just about fashion; it also highlighted the importance of family support. She was joined in the luxury suite by her father, Scott Swift, and Travis Kelce&rsquo;s father, Ed Kelce. The familial atmosphere added an extra layer of warmth to the evening as they celebrated Kelce&rsquo;s recent 35th birthday just days prior. A win for the Chiefs would undoubtedly make for an even more festive occasion.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Addressing Relationship Speculations</strong></h2>
<h4>Swift's attendance at this game followed a brief hiatus from previous matches, raising eyebrows among fans regarding her relationship with Kelce. Reports had circulated about potential troubles between the couple, but insiders quickly dispelled these rumors, emphasizing that their relationship remains strong and focused on mutual support rather than media speculation. They are reportedly committed to enjoying their time together while navigating their busy schedules.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Balancing Career and Personal Life</strong></h2>
<h4>As both Swift and Kelce juggle their demanding careers&mdash;Swift gearing up for the resumption of her "Eras Tour" on October 18 in Miami&mdash;it's clear that they prioritize their relationship amidst their professional commitments. An insider shared that they are currently focused on their respective projects and are looking forward to spending quality time together during breaks in their schedules.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Impact of Swift's Game Day Appearances</strong></h2>
<h4>Swift's appearances at Chiefs games have not only captivated fans but have also sparked discussions about celebrity influence in sports culture. Her fashionable entries into Arrowhead Stadium have become a talking point among fans and media alike, blurring the lines between entertainment and sports. As she continues to support Kelce from the stands, it&rsquo;s evident that her presence brings an added layer of excitement to the games.</h4>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>
<h4>While Swift&rsquo;s future attendance at upcoming Chiefs games remains uncertain due to her tour schedule&mdash;three shows coincide with Chiefs games&mdash;her impact on both football culture and fashion is undeniable. As she continues to balance her personal life with her professional endeavors, fans eagerly await what she will bring next to both the music scene and the sports arena.</h4>
<h4>In summary, Taylor Swift's recent appearance at Arrowhead Stadium not only showcased her impeccable style but also highlighted her supportive role in Travis Kelce's life as he navigates his football career. With each game she attends, Swift continues to redefine what it means to be a celebrity in today&rsquo;s world&mdash;one who embraces both personal passion and public spectacle with grace and flair.</h4>b3:T156e,<p>In a significant breach of cybersecurity, a group of hackers linked to the Chinese government, known as <strong><a href="https://securityaffairs.com/169460/apt/salt-typhoon-hacked-us-broadband-providers.html">Salt Typhoon</a></strong>, has successfully infiltrated the networks of several major U.S. telecommunications companies, including <strong><a href="https://www.att.com/">AT&amp;T</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/">Verizon</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html">Lumen Technologies</a></strong>. This intrusion potentially compromises sensitive data related to law enforcement operations, particularly information concerning court-authorized wiretaps. The implications of this breach are profound, as it raises serious concerns about national security and the integrity of U.S. communication infrastructure.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Details of the Hack</strong></h2>
<p>The Salt Typhoon group is believed to have gained access to systems used by these telecom providers to process lawful wiretap requests.

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Investigative Response</strong></h2>
<p>The investigation into this cyberattack involves multiple stakeholders, including <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in">Microsoft </a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a href="https://www.mandiant.com/">Mandiant</a></strong>, a subsidiary of <strong><a href="https://www.google.co.in/">Google</a></strong>. These firms are collaborating with the FBI and other federal agencies to assess the scope and impact of the breach. Authorities have expressed alarm at the sophistication and persistence displayed by Salt Typhoon, which has been linked to various espionage activities attributed to Chinese state-sponsored hacking groups.</p>
<p>FBI Director <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray">Christopher Wray</a></strong> has highlighted a stark disparity in resources, noting that Chinese government-backed hackers outnumber FBI cyber personnel by a staggering ratio of 50 to 1. This imbalance underscores the challenges faced by U.S. cybersecurity efforts in countering state-sponsored threats.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Implications for U.S.-China Relations</strong></h2>
<p>This incident comes at a time when U.S.-China relations are already strained due to ongoing tensions over trade, technology, and military issues. Both nations have been attempting to manage these tensions diplomatically; however, the revelation of such a significant cyber breach complicates these efforts. The Chinese Embassy in Washington has denied any involvement in the hacking activities, accusing the U.S. of politicizing cybersecurity issues to tarnish China's reputation.</p>
<p>As investigations continue, there are concerns about how this incident might affect planned diplomatic communications between President Biden and President Xi Jinping. The potential fallout from this breach may hinder efforts to stabilize relations between the two powers amidst an already volatile geopolitical landscape.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Broader Context of Cybersecurity Threats</strong></h2>
<p>The Salt Typhoon incident is not an isolated case; it is part of a broader trend of cyber espionage attributed to Chinese state-sponsored groups targeting critical infrastructure in various sectors across the globe. Recent reports indicate that these groups have shifted their focus from merely stealing secrets to infiltrating essential U.S. infrastructure systems.</p>
<p>Such activities reflect a strategic approach by Beijing to gather intelligence on adversaries while compromising their operational capabilities. Cybersecurity experts warn that as technology evolves and becomes increasingly integrated into daily life and critical operations, the risks associated with such breaches will only grow.

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The infiltration of major U.S. telecom firms by hackers linked to the Chinese government represents a serious challenge for national security and international relations. As investigations unfold and more details emerge about the extent of this breach, it is crucial for both governmental and private sectors to bolster their defenses against such sophisticated cyber threats. The implications of this incident will likely resonate across diplomatic channels as both nations navigate the complexities of cybersecurity in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>b4:T12f3,<p>In a significant development within the tech industry, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg">Matt Mullenweg</a></strong>, the co-founder of <strong><a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic </a>&nbsp;</strong>and <strong><a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a></strong>, has initiated a controversial exit strategy for employees who do not align with his ongoing legal battle against WP Engine. This move has sparked discussions about corporate governance and employee relations in the face of escalating legal disputes.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Ultimatum and Its Implications</strong></h2>
<p>Mullenweg's &ldquo;Alignment Offer&rdquo; was presented to Automattic employees, allowing them to resign with a severance package of $30,000 or six months&rsquo; salary&mdash;whichever was greater, if they disagreed with his legal stance against WP Engine. This offer was time-sensitive, requiring responses by 8 PM UTC on October 3. Approximately 159 employees, representing about 8.4% of the workforce, accepted this offer, while the remaining 91.6% chose to forgo a potential $126 million in severance to remain with the company.</p>
<p>The decision to implement such an ultimatum reflects Mullenweg&rsquo;s acknowledgment of dissent among his staff regarding the legal conflict. He stated that it became evident that many employees were not in agreement with his actions, prompting this drastic measure.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Background of the Legal Conflict</strong></h2>
<p>The legal dispute centers around allegations made by Mullenweg against WP Engine for trademark violations. Mullenweg claims that WP Engine has misrepresented its role in promoting WordPress, which he described as &ldquo;bringing WordPress to the masses.&rdquo; In response to these accusations, WP Engine has filed a lawsuit against Mullenweg and Automattic, alleging extortion and abuse of power.</p>
<p>This ongoing feud has roots in a series of public exchanges where Mullenweg labeled WP Engine as a &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; to the WordPress community. Following these remarks, WP Engine retaliated with a cease-and-desist letter demanding retraction and clarification on several points regarding trademark usage and licensing fees.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Employee Reactions and Company Morale</strong></h2>
<p>The fallout from Mullenweg's ultimatum has raised concerns about employee morale at Automattic. While some employees opted for the buyout, others expressed discontent over the pressure to choose sides in a contentious legal battle. <strong><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/automattic-ceo-never-let-a-good-crisis-as-159-employees-take-severance-package-amid-big-fight/articleshow/113939366.cms">Mullenweg</a></strong> himself described the week leading up to the deadline as an &ldquo;emotional roller coaster,&rdquo; but noted that he felt &ldquo;much lighter&rdquo; after the departures.</p>
<p>Interestingly, data from the resignation responses revealed demographic trends: 63.5% of those who accepted the buyout were male, and a significant portion hailed from Automattic's Ecosystem business segment. Notably, among those who left were high-earning employees, including 18 individuals with salaries exceeding $200,000 annually.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Broader Impact on Automattic and WP Engine</strong></h2>
<p>As this legal battle unfolds, it poses broader implications for both companies involved and the WordPress ecosystem at large. The dispute highlights ongoing tensions between open-source software principles and commercial interests. Critics argue that such conflicts can undermine trust within the community that relies on collaborative development practices.</p>
<p>WP Engine's lawsuit seeks not only damages but also aims to protect its position within the WordPress ecosystem from what it describes as monopolistic practices by Automattic. The company has emphasized that its actions are necessary to safeguard its interests and those of its partners and customers.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Mullenweg&rsquo;s decision to offer an exit package to dissenting employees underscores the complexities of navigating corporate governance amid legal disputes. As Automattic and WP Engine continue their public clash over trademark rights and business practices, the ramifications will likely extend beyond their immediate interests, impacting employee relations and community trust in open-source initiatives.</p>
<p>The unfolding situation serves as a critical case study on how leadership decisions can influence organizational culture during times of conflict, ultimately shaping the future dynamics within one of the most widely used content management systems in existence today.</p>b5:T16b5,<p>In the midst of the 2024 presidential election, a high school social studies class in Long Island, New York, was engaged in a critical discussion. <strong><a href="https://m.facebook.com/people/Jayla-Rennocks/100011984233886/">Jayla Rennocks</a></strong> and her classmates were debating whether a social media post featuring Donald Trump and the words&nbsp;<a href="https://aderholtforcongress.org/"> "<strong>I'm voting Aderholt for Congress</strong>"</a> was propaganda, publicity, or news. This task was designed to help students recognize whether the information they consume online is intended to persuade them to vote for a candidate, buy a product, or inform them about a news event. Their teacher, Tayla Plotke, emphasized that this campaign ad was "trying to get you guys to do something," highlighting the importance of discerning the purpose behind online content.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Need for Systemic Change in Education</strong></h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/faculty/david-plotke/">Plotke</a></strong>, a seven-year veteran of the district and a history and technology enthusiast, is part of a generation of educators dedicated to teaching kids to examine the news sources they rely on and to determine which information to trust. This focus on news literacy is not unique to her school; more K-12 schools nationwide are incorporating this essential skill into their curricula. This year, they may address the exponential rise in disinformation online related to the 2024 presidential election, the Israel-Hamas war, or other critical topics.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Baldwin School District's Commitment to News Literacy</strong></h2>
<p>The Baldwin School District is among hundreds nationwide that require young people to learn news literacy skills before they graduate from high school. These skills include recognizing biases in news reports, spotting differences between news articles and advertisements, and identifying disinformation created by artificial intelligence. District leaders, educators, and students all agree that the ability to discern between factual news and disinformation is crucial for youth,</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Role of Educators in Teaching News Literacy</strong></h2>
<p>Educators like Plotke are at the forefront of this movement. They use various methods to teach students how to critically evaluate information. For instance, <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/howard-schneider/">Howard Schneider</a></strong> from Stony Brook University teaches a lesson called lateral reading, which involves leaving the text and looking for another source to verify whether what they're consuming is fact or fiction.</p>
<p>This approach has been shown to be effective; a 2022 study from Stanford University's Graduate School of Education found that students who received six 50-minute lessons on lateral reading skills were more likely to judge the credibility of digital content than those who hadn't been taught these skills.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>State Initiatives and Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Three states&mdash;Connecticut, Illinois, and New Jersey&mdash;require schools to teach kids news literacy. California, Colorado, Delaware, Ohio, Texas, and Delaware have passed bills requiring states to adopt news literacy standards, although these laws do not explicitly require teaching the skills. The availability of news literacy classes varies district-to-district and school-to-school, with some places not teaching it at all.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, educators are committed to integrating media literacy into their curricula. For example, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ericvanhouten/?hl=en">Erik Van Houten</a></strong>, an assistant principal and high school history teacher in Las Vegas, applied for a grant after noticing students sharing false information about the Israel-Hamas war online. His school was chosen to receive resources, and he developed a plan to teach students about the larger Israel-Palestine conflict and help them decipher inaccurate news.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Impact of News Literacy on Students</strong></h2>
<p>Students like Jayla Rennocks are already benefiting from these lessons. She and her classmates have learned to question whether the information they consume online comes from credible sources. Rennocks recently saw a post on X from Cardi B criticizing something Donald Trump said and immediately went to Google to check other sources to verify it. The skills she learned in class led her to trust her skepticism, and after checking with other sources, she was shocked to learn that what Cardi B stated was accurate.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Future of News Literacy Education</strong></h2>
<p>The News Literacy Project, a nonpartisan nonprofit, is working to make news literacy a graduation requirement nationwide. Their next partner is the Los Angeles Unified School District, which plans to integrate media literacy into elementary and secondary schools. This resource supports the development of critical thinking skills and provides students with the knowledge and tools to help determine the credibility of a source and separate fact from fiction.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the integration of news literacy into K-12 education is a critical step in equipping students to navigate the complex digital landscape. By teaching students to critically evaluate information, educators are preparing them to make informed decisions and participate responsibly in civic life. As the digital age continues to evolve, the need for systemic change in education to ensure all students are skilled in news literacy before they graduate high school becomes increasingly urgent.</p>b6:T120e,<p><a href="https://www.cvshealth.com/"><strong>CVS Health</strong></a> has confirmed plans to lay off approximately 2,900 employees as part of a broader strategy to reduce costs and enhance operational efficiency. This decision, which affects primarily corporate roles, represents less than 1% of the company's total workforce of around 300,000 employees. The move comes in response to ongoing challenges within the healthcare industry, including regulatory pressures and shifting consumer expectations.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Reasons Behind the Layoffs</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/p/Mike-DeAngelis-Music-100063477671670/"><strong>Mike DeAngelis</strong></a>, CVS Health's executive director of corporate communications, emphasized that the layoffs are a necessary step to ensure the company remains competitive in a rapidly evolving market. In an email statement to USA TODAY, he stated, "Our industry faces continued disruption, regulatory pressures, and evolving customer needs and expectations, so it is critical that we remain competitive and operate at peak performance.&rdquo; The layoffs are part of CVS's multi-year initiative aimed at achieving&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/10/01/cvs-layoffs-2024/75466456007/"> $2 billion</a></strong> in cost savings through various measures, including streamlining operations and investing in technology.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Impact on Employees</strong></h2>
<p>The layoffs will not affect front-line workers in CVS stores, pharmacies, or distribution centers. DeAngelis reassured that those impacted by the job cuts would receive severance pay and benefits, including access to outplacement services. "Decisions on which positions to eliminate were extremely difficult," he noted, reflecting the challenging nature of these decisions for the company. The majority of affected employees are expected to be notified within the week.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Previous Layoffs and Company Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>This latest round of job cuts follows a significant reduction in workforce last year when CVS eliminated about <strong><a href="https://www.livemint.com/https:/www.livemint.com/news/cvs-health-to-lay-off-nearly-2-900-employees-in-cost-cutting-push-11727815057665.html">5,000 non-customer-facing</a></strong> positions as part of its cost-reduction efforts. In 2021, the company also announced plans to close approximately 900 stores between 2022 and 2024. These actions highlight CVS's ongoing struggle to adapt to a changing retail landscape where traditional drugstore sales are declining due to increased competition from online retailers and big-box chains.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Financial Performance and Future Outlook</strong></h2>
<p>CVS Health's financial performance has been under scrutiny as it navigates a challenging environment. In its most recent quarterly report, the company revealed a 17% drop in adjusted earnings per share compared to the previous year. Additionally, same-store sales for non-prescription products fell by 4%, indicating shifting consumer behavior. As part of its strategic review, CVS is exploring ways to enhance shareholder value while continuing to focus on delivering high-quality healthcare products and services.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Recent Acquisitions and Strategic Initiatives</strong></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, CVS Health completed a significant acquisition by purchasing Oak Street Health for $10.6 billion. This deal aims to expand CVS's reach into primary care services for lower-to-middle-income individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. The acquisition aligns with CVS's goal of improving health outcomes while reducing costs within the Medicare program. Oak Street Health CEO Mike Pykosz expressed optimism about the partnership, stating that it would accelerate efforts to enhance patient experiences and lower medical costs.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>As CVS Health embarks on this latest phase of restructuring through layoffs and strategic initiatives, it aims to position itself more favorably within an increasingly competitive healthcare market. While the job cuts may provide short-term financial relief, the long-term success of these measures will depend on how effectively CVS can adapt its business model to meet evolving consumer needs and expectations. The company's ability to leverage technology and streamline operations will be critical as it strives to maintain its status as a leading player in the healthcare sector.</p>b7:T145c,<p>In a significant move towards enhancing financial inclusion in Indonesia, <strong><a href="https://krom.id/">PT Krom Bank Indonesia</a></strong> has entered into a strategic partnership with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services">Amazon Web Services (AWS)</a></strong>.

This decision, announced by <strong><a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/about/bio.php">Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar </a></strong>on August 14, highlights the ongoing clash between state governments and financial institutions over environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Texas' Energy Sector and the Clash with NatWest</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the United States, contributing <a href="https://www.disruptionbanking.com/2024/09/06/why-is-texas-not-doing-business-with-natwest/">&nbsp;<strong>over 43%</strong></a> of the country's crude oil production, Texas plays a crucial role in the nation's energy sector. The state generated over $26.3 billion in state and local tax revenue and royalties from the oil and natural gas industry last year alone. Texas' deep ties to the energy industry, with many energy giants calling the state home, have led to a clash with NatWest's ESG-driven policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NatWest's policy states that it will "not renew, refinance or extend existing reserve-based lending specifically to finance oil and gas exploration, extraction, and production" by 2026. This decision aligns with a wider trend among global banks aiming to cut down on their exposure to fossil fuels in favor of greener alternatives. However, for a state like Texas, where the energy sector is a cornerstone of the economy, such restrictions are viewed as a direct threat to its financial stability, interest, and growth.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Texas' Response and the Implications</strong></h2>
<p>In response to NatWest's policy, Texas added the bank to its boycott list, restricting its ability to do business with state agencies. This decision mirrors a similar situation involving Barclays, another British bank, which planned to withdraw from Israeli bond auctions. Both instances highlight the growing tension between state policies and the global banking industry's shift towards sustainable practices.</p>
<p>Texas has long been known for its pro-energy stance, often clashing with environmental groups and, increasingly, with financial institutions. The state has previously targeted other financial institutions with similar policies, putting UBS, BlackRock, Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, HSBC Plc, and others on its divestment statute list titled "financial companies that boycott energy companies." With the addition of NatWest, the list now includes 16 financial institutions.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Implications for the Energy Sector and the Banking Industry</strong></h2>
<p>The energy sector could face significant challenges due to the restrictions imposed by NatWest. With one less financial institution willing to support fossil fuel projects, energy companies might find it harder to secure funding, leading to delays or cancellations of new projects and potentially impacting the overall energy supply. This decision could also push other banks to reconsider their policies on energy financing, further squeezing the energy sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For NatWest, being added to Texas' boycott list could result in economic losses and reputational damage, particularly if other states follow Texas' lead. The situation highlights the delicate balance banks like NatWest must strike between their commitment to sustainable practices and the realities of doing business in energy-rich regions like Texas.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Long-term Effects and the Future of Energy Financing</strong></h2>
<p>The long-term effects of Texas' decision could be far-reaching. If more states decide to follow Texas' lead, we could see an economically unhealthy fragmentation in the financial industry where banks are forced to choose sides. This could lead to a situation where banks either double down on their ESG commitments or back away from them to avoid losing business in key markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the world shifts towards greener alternatives, banks like NatWest must navigate the fragile balance between ethical practices and business interests. The precedent set by Texas could lead to a new era of state-level activism against banks based on their ESG policies, reshaping the future of energy financing in the United States and beyond.</p>b9:Tcaa,<p>In a move to kick off the back-to-school season, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Education">U.S. Deputy Secretary of Education</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cindy_Marten">Cindy Marten</a></strong> embarked on a bus tour to Pennsylvania on Thursday, making stops at two local schools in Erie.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a landmark act of generosity, Greek-American Roy Vagelos and his wife, Diana, have donated an astonishing $400 million (&euro;360 million) to Columbia University. This record-breaking contribution marks the largest single donation ever received by the university's medical school and is poised to transform the landscape of biomedical science research and education.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Game-Changer for Columbia&rsquo;s Medical School</strong></p>
<p>This monumental gift underscores the Vagelos family's commitment to advancing science and medicine. The donation is set to solidify Columbia&rsquo;s position as a trailblazer in the field of biomedical science. The funds will be directed towards expanding the Roy and Diana Vagelos Institute for Basic Biomedical Science, a cutting-edge research facility established just last year with a previous generous donation of $175 million (&euro;158 million) from the Vagelos family.</p>
<p>The Institute is designed to be a hub of innovation, fostering groundbreaking research and training the next generation of physician-scientists. Columbia University envisions this expansion as a critical step towards creating a premier ecosystem for biomedical research, integrating efforts across basic science, medical education, and clinical research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building a Future of Biomedical Excellence</strong></p>
<p>A significant portion of the recent donation will be allocated to the construction of the Vagelos Innovation Laboratories. This new facility, set to rise at 167th Street and Audubon Avenue on the Washington Heights medical campus, will feature more than 55,000 square feet (5,110 square meters) of state-of-the-art laboratory space. Notably, it will be the first fully electrified, university-owned laboratory building in New York City, highlighting the Vagelos family's dedication to advancing research infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new laboratories are designed to house cutting-edge biomedical research and are expected to support pioneering work in cell engineering and gene therapy. The facilities will also bolster collaborations that leverage recent technological breakthroughs, aiming to develop next-generation therapies for a wide array of conditions, including blood and immune disorders, cancers, metabolic and inflammatory diseases, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Legacy of Visionary Leadership</strong></p>
<p>Roy Vagelos, born on October 8, 1929, in Westfield, New Jersey, to Greek immigrant parents, has had a distinguished career in the pharmaceutical industry. He served as president and CEO of Merck &amp; Co. and later as chairman. Since 1995, Vagelos has been chairman of the board at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Earlier this year, he was honored with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Dartmouth College, recognizing his significant contributions to science and medicine.</p>
<p>Columbia University expressed profound gratitude to the Vagelos family, stating, &ldquo;We want to express our deep appreciation to Roy and Diana, both for their truly visionary leadership and for their faith in Columbia, its people, and our shared future.&rdquo; This historic donation not only reflects the Vagelos family's unwavering commitment to scientific advancement but also sets a new benchmark for philanthropic impact in higher education and research.</p>
<p>The Vagelos&rsquo; remarkable contribution will undoubtedly drive significant advancements in biomedical science, ensuring that Columbia University remains at the forefront of innovation and discovery for years to come.</p>bd:Tdd2,<p>As the humanitarian crisis in Sudan deepens, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) is redoubling its efforts to provide life-saving assistance to millions grappling with acute hunger. With the conflict stretching into its 500th day, WFP's mission has become more critical than ever, focusing on delivering vital food aid to 14 regions plagued by famine or facing imminent risk of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Border Breakthrough: Chad&rsquo;s Adre Crossing Vital for Food Supply</strong></p>
<p>Recent progress has been made thanks to the reopening of Chad&rsquo;s Adre border crossing, which has become a lifeline for Sudanese communities in desperate need. On August 27, WFP trucks carrying over 630 metric tons of essential supplies&mdash;enough to sustain nearly 55,000 people&mdash;crossed into Sudan's Darfur region. This significant delivery is aimed at aiding communities in Kereneik and Sirba, areas severely threatened by famine in West Darfur. Although some supplies have already reached Mornei in Kereneik, others are still en route, hampered by damaged bridges and deteriorating road conditions as the rainy season intensifies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Obstacles: Floods and Damaged Roads Challenge Aid Delivery</strong></p>
<p>The flow of humanitarian aid through Adre has faced considerable challenges. Seasonal rains have flooded roads and riverbeds, impeding the progress of convoys. Despite these obstacles, WFP is working tirelessly to ensure a steady stream of aid, targeting assistance for half a million people in Darfur. Meanwhile, an additional 1,134 metric tons of food&mdash;sufficient for around 280,000 individuals&mdash;was transported via the Tine border crossing last week. This aid, previously stalled due to floodwaters, is now making its way to famine-stricken areas, though distribution will be delayed due to ongoing poor road conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From Cash to Food: Comprehensive Support for Sudanese Communities</strong></p>
<p>In addition to food deliveries, WFP is implementing cash assistance programs to support families across Darfur. Initial cash transfers have begun in Ardamata and El Riad, with plans to expand to Kulbus and Zalingei in the coming weeks. This initiative will benefit 300,000 individuals, providing them with critical financial support to purchase essential items amidst the crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feeding the Displaced: Targeted Aid for Flood-Affected and Newly Displaced Populations</strong></p>
<p>The scope of WFP's aid extends beyond Darfur. In Khartoum, the organization has successfully completed food distributions to 45,000 displaced individuals in Karrari. In August alone, WFP-supported community kitchens in Khartoum served nearly 180,000 hot meals daily, with continued nutrition support in Karrari, Omdurman, and Umbada. Cash distributions are set to commence next week in two Khartoum localities at high risk of famine.</p>
<p>Additionally, WFP has provided high-energy biscuits to 14,000 flood-affected internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Kassala, who were displaced by conflict in Sinja, Sennar state. Food distributions for around 80,000 newly displaced individuals in Gedaref and Kassala are ongoing.</p>
<p>As the situation remains fluid and the humanitarian needs grow, WFP's comprehensive approach&mdash;combining direct food aid with cash assistance&mdash;represents a critical lifeline for millions of Sudanese facing the dire consequences of prolonged conflict and instability.</p>be:T1211,<p><strong>A Milestone Moment for MINISO</strong></p>

<p>In a significant advancement for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <a href="https://www.celltrion.com/">Celltrion USA </a>has announced a groundbreaking partnership with two of the nation's leading healthcare providers, Cigna Healthcare and Express Scripts. This strategic collaboration is set to make <a href="https://www.zymfentra.com/">ZYMFENTRA&reg;</a> (infliximab-dyyb), the first and only FDA-approved subcutaneous infliximab, more accessible to millions of Americans suffering from conditions like ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn&rsquo;s disease (CD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting August 1, 2024, ZYMFENTRA&reg; has been included in the medical benefit formulary of Cigna Healthcare, potentially reaching over 16 million insured lives. This landmark agreement not only solidifies ZYMFENTRA&reg;'s status as a preferred treatment option but also underscores Celltrion USA&rsquo;s commitment to delivering innovative healthcare solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A New Era for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment</strong></p>
<p>ZYMFENTRA&reg; offers a novel approach to managing IBD. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023, ZYMFENTRA&reg; provides maintenance therapy for adults with moderate to severe <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20240828cn92006/celltrion-usa-partners-with-express-scripts-and-cigna-healthcare-to-expand-access-to-zymfentra-infliximab-dyyb-the-first-and-only-fda-approved-subcutaneous-infliximab-on-their-medical-benefit-formulary">UC and CD.</a> Unlike traditional treatments that require intravenous (IV) administration, ZYMFENTRA&reg; is administered subcutaneously, offering a more convenient option for patients. This subcutaneous form allows patients to manage their condition with greater flexibility, potentially reducing the need for frequent hospital visits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Celltrion USA is dedicated to broadening access to innovative and effective treatment options," said Francine Galante, Vice President of Market Access at Celltrion USA. "Our partnership with Cigna and Express Scripts will enhance the choices available to physicians and patients. We believe ZYMFENTRA&reg; will deliver substantial value as an alternative administration option, allowing patients to have greater flexibility in managing their disease."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pioneering Subcutaneous Biologics</strong></p>
<p>ZYMFENTRA&reg; is not just another medication; it is a game-changer in the field of biologics. It works by targeting and blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a protein that, when overproduced, causes the immune system to attack healthy tissues. By inhibiting this protein, ZYMFENTRA&reg; helps to reduce the inflammation and other symptoms associated with UC and CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new form of treatment is part of a growing trend in the healthcare industry to develop biologics that can be administered in less invasive ways, thereby improving patient compliance and outcomes. ZYMFENTRA&reg;'s subcutaneous delivery method is particularly advantageous for patients who have undergone prior treatment with IV-administered infliximab products, offering them a new, easier way to maintain their health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing Patient Access and Safety</strong></p>
<p>The collaboration between Celltrion USA, Cigna, and Express Scripts is designed not only to provide broader access to ZYMFENTRA&reg; but also to ensure the safety and well-being of patients. Serious infections, including tuberculosis (TB), fungal infections, and opportunistic infections, are potential risks associated with ZYMFENTRA&reg;. As part of the treatment protocol, patients will be monitored closely for signs of infection, and those with latent TB or other chronic infections will receive necessary treatment before beginning ZYMFENTRA&reg; therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This focus on patient safety is a testament to Celltrion USA&rsquo;s commitment to providing high-quality, safe, and effective treatment options. With ZYMFENTRA&reg;'s inclusion in the Cigna formulary, more patients will have access to this innovative therapy, improving the quality of life for those suffering from debilitating gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead: The Future of Biologics in IBD Care</strong></p>
<p>As Celltrion USA continues to innovate, the company remains focused on its mission to make high-quality biopharmaceuticals accessible to U.S. patients. With five biosimilars already approved by the FDA, including INFLECTRA&reg; and HERZUMA&reg;, and now the pioneering ZYMFENTRA&reg;, Celltrion USA is leading the charge in the development of cutting-edge treatments for chronic diseases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For patients with UC and CD, the introduction of ZYMFENTRA&reg; represents hope and the possibility of a more manageable and effective treatment regimen. As the landscape of biologics evolves, partnerships like this will be crucial in ensuring that innovative therapies reach those who need them most, paving the way for a future where chronic diseases can be managed more effectively and with greater ease.</p>c0:T124e,<p><strong>Opening New Doors to World-Class Education</strong></p>

<p><strong>Reflecting on Don Liu&rsquo;s Legacy at Target</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don Liu&rsquo;s retirement marks the end of an era for <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a>. Having joined the company in 2016 from Xerox, Liu has been a key figure in shaping the company&rsquo;s legal strategy and fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion within the legal profession. His contributions to Target extend beyond legal matters, as he has been a mentor to countless teammates and peers, and a strong advocate for the company&rsquo;s broader strategic objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cornell praised Liu&rsquo;s impact, stating, "Over the course of his distinguished career, Don has made an incredible impact on Target and the legal industry. As a member of our leadership team, he was an advocate for our company strategy, served as a mentor to teammates and peers and is regarded as a trailblazer for diversity, equity and inclusion within the legal profession. We&rsquo;re grateful for his many contributions and wish him nothing but the best."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liu&rsquo;s departure from the role is set against a backdrop of broader shifts within the U.S. retail sector. Just earlier this year, <a href="https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/">Walgreens Boots Alliance</a> appointed <a href="https://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/about-us/leadership/lanesha-minnix">Lanesha Minnix</a> as its new Chief Legal Officer, replacing former White House lawyer Danielle Gray. These changes highlight the dynamic nature of legal leadership within major U.S. corporations as they adapt to new challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Target&rsquo;s Forward-Looking Legal Strategy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amy Tu&rsquo;s appointment signals Target&rsquo;s intent to continue its legacy of strong legal governance while embracing innovation and growth. Her extensive experience across various industries and her leadership in international markets make her uniquely qualified to steer Target through the evolving legal landscape. As she takes on this new challenge, the retail giant is poised to benefit from her strategic vision and legal acumen, ensuring that Target remains a leader not just in retail, but in corporate governance and compliance as well.</p>c2:T117e,<h4><strong>Rising Cancer Incidence in Younger Generations</strong></h4>
<p>A groundbreaking study published in the Lancet Public Health journal has revealed alarming trends regarding cancer incidence among Generation X and millennials. Researchers from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cancer_Society">American Cancer Society (ACS) </a>analyzed 34 of the most common cancers and discovered that younger generations face a significantly higher risk of developing certain types of cancer compared to earlier generations. The study's findings underscore the urgency of addressing the growing cancer burden among these age groups.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Findings: Increase in Multiple Cancer Types</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/07/31/cancer-rates-younger-generations/">The study</a>&nbsp;identified that cancer incidence rates have been rising in progressively younger generations for 17 out of the 34 cancers studied. Notably, the increase was particularly significant for breast, pancreatic, and gastric cancers. For eight of these 17 cancers, the incidence rates have been climbing steadily with each successive birth cohort since 1920. For the remaining nine cancers, the rates initially declined in older cohorts but then surged in younger ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings add to growing evidence of increased cancer risk in post-Baby Boomer generations,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/acs-researchers/hyuna-sung.html">Hyuna Sung</a>, lead author of the study. The study expands on previous research that highlighted early-onset colorectal cancer and a few obesity-associated cancers, now encompassing a broader range of cancer types.</p>
<h4><strong>Understanding the Underlying Risk Factors</strong></h4>
<p>Ahmedin Jemal, a senior author of the study, emphasized the critical need to identify and address the underlying risk factors contributing to these rising cancer rates. "Birth cohorts, groups of people classified by their birth year, share unique social, economic, political, and climate environments, which affect their exposure to cancer risk factors during their crucial developmental years," explained Sung. However, the exact reasons for the rising rates remain unclear.</p>
<p><a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/GO.22.00405">The research</a>&nbsp;utilized data from over 23 million patients diagnosed with 34 types of cancer between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2019. Mortality data from more than 7 million deaths due to 25 types of cancers during the same period were also analyzed. The study focused on individuals aged 25 to 84 and calculated the incidence rate ratios for each birth cohort, adjusting for age and period effects.</p>
<h4><strong>Significant Differences Among Birth Cohorts</strong></h4>
<p>One of the striking revelations of the study was the considerable variation in cancer incidence rates among different birth cohorts. For instance, the youngest birth cohort, 1990, exhibited a cancer incidence rate for ovarian cancer that was 12 percent higher than the birth cohort with the lowest rate. Even more concerning, the incidence rate for uterine corpus cancer was 169 percent higher in the 1990 cohort compared to the lowest-rate cohort.</p>
<p>Pancreatic, kidney, and small intestinal cancers showed incidence rates that were two to three times higher in the 1990 birth cohort than in the 1955 cohort. These dramatic increases signal potential generational shifts in cancer risk, raising concerns about future cancer burdens.</p>
<h4><strong>Implications and Call to Action</strong></h4>
<p>Jemal warned that the rising cancer rates among younger generations could indicate significant generational shifts in cancer risk and serve as an early indicator of future cancer burdens. "Without effective population-level interventions, and as the elevated risk in younger generations is carried over as individuals age, an overall increase in cancer burden could occur in the future, halting or reversing decades of progress against the disease," he cautioned.</p>
<p>The study highlights the pressing need for targeted research and public health initiatives to understand and mitigate the factors contributing to the increased cancer risk among Generation X and millennials. By addressing these issues proactively, there is hope to curb the rising tide of cancer incidence and protect future generations from its devastating impact.</p>c3:T18da,<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>JD Vance's "Cat Lady" Comment Sparks Nationwide Outrage</strong></span></h4>

<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>The controversy has drawn reactions from all corners, including high-profile celebrities like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jenniferaniston/?hl=en">Jennifer Aniston</a> , Whoopi Goldberg, and Alyssa Farah Griffin. Vance&rsquo;s statement specifically targeted prominent Democrats such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, criticizing them for not having children.</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>&ldquo;We are effectively run in this country &hellip; by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they&rsquo;ve made, and so they wanna make the rest of the country miserable, too,&rdquo; Vance told Carlson. &ldquo;It's just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children.&rdquo;</strong></span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Defending the Comment</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>In response to the backlash, Vance addressed the issue in an interview on The Megyn Kelly Show. He emphasized that his comment was meant to be sarcastic and not taken literally. &ldquo;Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment,&rdquo; Vance stated. &ldquo;I've got nothing against cats. I've got nothing against dogs. ... People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not the substance of what I actually said.&rdquo;</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Vance used the opportunity to reinforce the Republican Party&rsquo;s &ldquo;pro-family&rdquo; stance, contrasting it with what he described as the Democrats&rsquo; &ldquo;anti-child&rdquo; policies, particularly highlighting their approach during the COVID-19 pandemic.</strong></span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Personal Attacks and Political Fallout</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Jennifer Aniston took to Instagram to voice her dismay, sharing a screenshot of the Fox News video and writing, &ldquo;I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.&rdquo; She further expressed hope that Vance&rsquo;s daughter would not face fertility issues and criticized his stance on reproductive rights, referencing the Right to IVF Act, which failed to advance in the Senate due to opposition from most Republican representatives.</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Aniston&rsquo;s response is deeply personal, as she has publicly shared her own fertility struggles.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Defending Family and Choice</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Ella Emhoff, the stepdaughter of Kamala Harris, also defended her family against Vance&rsquo;s remarks. In an Instagram Story, she pointed out that Harris does indeed have children in her life, highlighting the role of stepchildren.</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>On &ldquo;The View,&rdquo; Whoopi Goldberg delivered a passionate rebuttal to Vance&rsquo;s comments. She highlighted that many people, including historical figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a>, did not have biological children but were still influential leaders. Goldberg's criticism extended to the notion that not having children makes one less invested in the country&rsquo;s future.</strong></span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>The Political Implications</strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Farah_Griffin">Alyssa Farah Griffin</a>, a former Trump White House communications director, added her voice to the chorus of criticism. She underscored the insensitivity of Vance&rsquo;s remarks, particularly towards women facing infertility, miscarriages, or those who haven&rsquo;t yet found the right partner. Griffin emphasized that such women are valuable members of society with a significant stake in its future. </strong></span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Vance&rsquo;s controversial remarks have undoubtedly stirred the political pot, drawing attention to the broader cultural and ideological divides in America.

As the world grapples with a shortage of human therapists and a surge in mental health challenges, millions are turning to AI-powered bots for support, guidance, and a listening ear.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/molly-pennington-b714b9244"><strong>Molly Pennington</strong></a>, a woman from the UK, found herself at the crossroads of this brave new world when she experienced a panic attack. <strong><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/05/15/turned-ai-therapist-a-panic-attack-20769361/?ito=article.mweb.share.bottom.link">Initially "outright cynical"</a></strong> about the idea of seeking help from an AI therapist, she decided to give it a chance, typing "AI Therapy" into Google and clicking on the first link that greeted her with a disclaimer: "This is not a replacement for medical or professional help."</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Bot and the Panic Attack</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Molly was then connected with an AI therapist through automated messages. After introducing herself, she explained her situation &ndash; a panic attack in progress. The bot promptly guided her through a series of grounding exercises focused on her breathing. To Molly's surprise, the exercises proved effective, and her panic attack began to subside.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Human Touch</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://www.beatthegmat.com/confusing-question-t57596.html"><strong>Despite the positive outcome</strong></a>, Molly couldn't shake the feeling of unease that stemmed from the realization that she wasn't communicating with a human being. "Somehow it felt performative and disingenuous," she confided to Metro. "I've never had that feeling in traditional therapy &ndash; though admittedly this could be because I've been lucky to only work with fantastic therapists and because I knew they were human!"</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Limitations and Concerns</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">As Molly reflected on her experience, she expressed concerns about the potential limitations of AI therapists in handling more complex situations beyond panic attacks. "Don't misunderstand, I'm glad I tried it and it certainly helped me in the moment, but I'm not sure if I would personally use AI therapy again," she said. "I can't see myself reaching for it for general advice, like if I'm anxious about work or have an argument with a family member. And if I was having a panic attack, I think I would prefer to watch a YouTube video of a guided grounding activity."</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Accessibility and Affordability</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">However, Molly acknowledged the harsh reality that private therapy is often prohibitively expensive for many, and AI therapy may offer a more accessible alternative. "Only time will tell if AI therapy is better than nothing. I just hope our most vulnerable don't pay the price while we wait for an answer," she cautioned.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Future of Mental Health Support</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">As the world grapples with the implications of AI therapists, one thing is clear: the landscape of mental health support is undergoing a seismic shift. Whether AI will prove to be a revolutionary force for good or a double-edged sword remains to be seen.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Dire Findings</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The survey, conducted via both online and in-person methods, revealed a concerning trend of asymmetry in the views held by <strong><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36617992/">Jewish and Arab individuals.</a></strong>&nbsp;It noted that Jewish students and teachers exhibited more negative sentiments towards their Arab counterparts, with a prevalent skepticism about the possibility of co-existence.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Positive Discoveries</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"> Despite the grim outlook, the survey also highlighted an encouraging aspect: increased exposure between the <strong><a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2024.pdf">two groups</a></strong> significantly reduced negative perceptions. This finding was interpreted as a testament to the potential for peaceful coexistence through mutual understanding.</span></h4>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Cross-Cultural Perceptions</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Participants who interacted with members of the other cultural group displayed a more optimistic outlook towards peaceful coexistence. Arab teachers and students, in particular, exhibited a greater openness to mixed living and expressed a desire to engage with members of the Jewish community.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Educational Needs</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">A notable finding was the expressed need for additional tools and resources to teach about the other cultural group. Both Jewish and Arab teachers expressed an interest in enhancing their understanding and interaction with counterparts from the opposite cultural group.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Positive Effects of Interaction</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The survey underscored the positive impact of interaction on perceptions and attitudes. Participants who engaged with members of the other cultural group reported lower levels of hatred and increased feelings of affection post-interaction.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Call to Action</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The Abraham Initiatives emphasized the urgent need to expand interactions between Jewish and Arab individuals within the education system. They advocated for the implementation of programs aimed at fostering mutual understanding, language learning, and anti-racism training among teachers.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Conclusion</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In conclusion, the survey findings underscored the importance of promoting dialogue and interaction between Jewish and Arab individuals in Israeli schools.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Seasonal Patterns and Preparation:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">PAHO highlighted the cyclical nature of dengue outbreaks, with cases typically peaking in the first half of the year in the southern hemisphere and later in the northern hemisphere. As spring approaches in the northern hemisphere, authorities must remain vigilant and prepare for a potential increase in cases.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Factors Contributing to the Surge:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">PAHO identified several factors contributing to the surge in dengue cases, including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, rapid population growth, and inadequate sanitation infrastructure. These conditions create conducive environments for mosquito breeding, exacerbating the spread of the virus.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Role of Vaccination:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">While vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the severity of dengue cases and preventing fatalities, PAHO emphasized that it cannot immediately halt outbreaks. Early detection, access to medical care, and effective mosquito control measures are essential components of the response strategy.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Mosquito-Borne Threat:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Dengue, transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, poses a significant public health threat, causing flu-like symptoms and, in severe cases, potentially fatal complications. The virus's prevalence in urban and semi-urban areas underscores the need for comprehensive prevention and control measures.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Hospital Challenges:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Hospitals, overwhelmed by the influx of dengue patients, are facing unprecedented challenges. Facilities like Lima&rsquo;s Hospital Sergio Bernales are struggling to accommodate the surge in cases, highlighting the urgent need for additional resources and support.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Preventive Measures and Global Impact:</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">PAHO emphasized the importance of implementing comprehensive strategies focusing on surveillance, mosquito control, and clinical management to mitigate the outbreak's impact. Given dengue's global endemic status, concerted efforts are necessary to address the threat posed by the virus across the Americas and beyond.</span></h4>c9:T1607,<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Michigan is boosting its efforts to cultivate talent in advanced manufacturing through an expanded partnership with the SME Education Foundation. <strong><a href="https://www.smeef.org/prime-schools-initiative/sme-prime/">The SME PRIME&reg;</a></strong> program, a public-private initiative, is set to reach more high schools across the state, offering students hands-on experience and training in manufacturing and engineering.</span></h4>

Beyond chickens, the virus has also infected dairy cows, with reports of one person in Texas contracting the virus after contact with affected cattle.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Massive Losses and Economic Impact</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">As the avian influenza virus spreads, major egg producers are faced with the grim necessity of culling millions of chickens to contain the outbreak. This drastic measure not only results in significant economic losses for producers but also threatens to escalate grocery prices for consumers.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Economic Implications on Egg Prices</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://experts.okstate.edu/amy.hagerman"><strong>Amy Hagerman</strong>,</a> a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, warns of potential price increases for eggs due to the sudden reduction in supply caused by the mass culling of laying hens. Unlike typical post-Easter drops in egg prices, consumers may experience sustained or even rising costs in the aftermath of the outbreak.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Lingering Effects from Previous Outbreaks</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The current avian influenza outbreak compounds existing challenges faced by the poultry industry. Prices for eggs have yet to fully recover from the tumultuous fluctuations experienced over the past two years, including the significant disruptions caused by the<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p0401-avian-flu.html"><strong> bird flu outbreaks in 2022</strong>.</a></span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Impact on Dairy Industry</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In addition to poultry, the dairy industry is also feeling the effects of the avian influenza outbreak. Reports from Texas reveal a concerning decline in milk production, accompanied by symptoms of illness among dairy cows. However, unlike the devastating impact on poultry, the virus appears less severe and contagious among cattle.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Lesser Impact on Poultry Prices</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">While the avian influenza outbreak has led to the depopulation of millions of egg-laying chickens, the prices of poultry products, particularly broiler chickens, remain relatively stable. Commercial broiler operations have not been significantly affected, although certain turkey flocks have reported cases of infection.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Assurance of Food Safety</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Despite the disruptions caused by the avian influenza outbreak, consumers can rest assured that stringent food safety measures remain in place. Both eggs and milk undergo pasteurization, effectively eliminating any traces of the virus and ensuring the safety of these essential food products.</span></h4>

In an interview with Reuters, CEO Ana Cabral-Gardner emphasized the company's commitment to its near-term expansion initiatives rather than pursuing a sale. Despite facing challenges such as lower lithium prices and executive shake-ups, Sigma Lithium is determined to strengthen its position in the market and capitalize on growth opportunities.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Based in Vancouver, Sigma Lithium primarily operates a hard rock lithium project located at Brazil's Grota do Cirilo. Over the past year, the company had been exploring potential buyers, but the persistently low lithium prices, driven by slower-than-expected electric vehicle (EV) adoption and oversupply issues in China, have led the CEO to shift focus towards expanding operations.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Cabral-Gardner expressed her stance clearly, stating, "At these prices, we are not selling." Instead, she emphasized the strategic objective of building a sustainable business by doubling capacity. This decision reflects the company's long-term vision and commitment to maximizing value for its stakeholders.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Previously, Sigma Lithium had engaged Bank of America as its adviser to explore acquisition opportunities. Despite receiving proposals from various industries including energy, automotive, batteries, and lithium refining, the company has opted to pursue internal growth strategies in response to the challenging market conditions.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In addition to grappling with the impact of declining lithium prices, Sigma Lithium has encountered internal turbulence, including executive turnovers and legal disputes. The termination of former co-CEO Calvyn Gardner and subsequent legal battles have added complexity to the company's operations. However, Cabral-Gardner remains focused on steering Sigma Lithium towards success amidst these challenges.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">While Bank of America continues to lead a strategic review of the company, Cabral-Gardner refrained from divulging specific details. She acknowledged the unfavorable market conditions but remained optimistic about Sigma Lithium's prospects for growth.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In the face of adversity, Sigma Lithium is pursuing an ambitious growth trajectory, aiming to double its size by next year. The company recently announced plans to increase production to 520,000 metric tons per year by 2025, investing $100 million to install a second production line at its Greentech Industrial Plant in Brazil. This expansion initiative underscores Sigma Lithium's confidence in its ability to thrive in the lithium market.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Brazil's significance as a major exporter of lithium further reinforces Sigma Lithium's strategic positioning. Despite the country's reliance on biofuels, Sigma Lithium aims to capitalize on its lithium reserves and contribute to the global supply chain for EV batteries.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Sigma Lithium's commitment to expansion was further validated by a positive market response, with its shares experiencing an uptick following the announcement of its production expansion plans. This demonstrates investor confidence in the company's growth strategy and its potential to deliver value in a challenging market environment.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Despite facing arbitration initiated by LG Energy Solution over alleged breaches of a supply agreement, Sigma Lithium remains steadfast in defending its position. The company refutes the allegations and remains focused on advancing its production and expansion objectives.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In conclusion, Sigma Lithium's CEO's decision to prioritize internal growth over a potential sale reflects the company's resilience and determination to navigate challenging market conditions. With a clear vision and strategic initiatives in place, Sigma Lithium remains poised for sustainable growth and success in the lithium industry.</span></h4>cf:Tca1,<p>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), a global IT giant, has secured a significant deal with Central Bank, a prominent Midwest regional lender based in the United States, to implement TCS BaNCS for the modernization of its core technology infrastructure.

March, designated as Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, serves as a reminder of the necessity to educate and inform the public about this rising health concern.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>As a surgeon, the impact of cancer is a reality I witness daily. The loss of a dear friend, a doctor, father, and husband, to colon cancer at the age of 38 remains a poignant reminder of the urgency surrounding this disease. In 2017, I experienced my own health scare, prompting me to undergo a colonoscopy despite not meeting the standard screening criteria due to my age. This decision was driven by the memory of my friend and the necessity for proactive measures in combating colon cancer.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Experts recommend initiating colon cancer screening via colonoscopy at the age of 45, although individual circumstances may warrant earlier assessment. The American Cancer Society projects approximately 106,590 new cases of colon cancer in the United States this year, with rates steadily increasing among individuals younger than 55 since the mid-1990s. Despite advancements in screening and lifestyle modifications, the prevalence of colon cancer remains a concern, underscoring the importance of early detection efforts.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Understanding the anatomy and function of the colon is crucial in comprehending the significance of screening. The colon, integral to the digestive process, facilitates waste management and houses a diverse microbiome vital for overall health. Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month serves as a reminder that cancer can affect any segment of the colon, necessitating comprehensive screening approaches.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The colonoscopy procedure, essential for early detection and prevention, involves a meticulous preparation process followed by the insertion of a colonoscope to visualize any abnormalities. Biopsies or removal of polyps during the procedure can prevent potential complications, highlighting the proactive nature of colon cancer screening.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Despite recommendations for regular screenings, apprehensions surrounding discomfort and preparation deter many individuals from undergoing colonoscopies or stool-based tests. This reluctance contributes to a significant portion of the eligible population remaining unscreened, emphasizing the need for accessible and less invasive screening methods.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>A recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine showcased a promising blood-based screening test for colon cancer, boasting an 83% effectiveness in detecting the disease. Although not a replacement for colonoscopies, this test could potentially increase screening rates and aid in early detection efforts upon approval by regulatory agencies.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>In conclusion, prioritizing proactive health measures, including regular screenings and awareness of potential symptoms, is paramount in combating colon cancer. The memory of lost loved ones and personal health scares serve as poignant reminders of the importance of early detection and intervention. By fostering a culture of vigilance and prioritizing preventive healthcare, we can mitigate the impact of colon cancer and improve outcomes for individuals and communities alike.</h5>d1:T14e6,<p>Colon cancer remains a significant cause of mortality worldwide, despite being highly preventable and treatable if detected early. However, traditional screening methods such as colonoscopies and fecal tests face significant barriers due to their invasive nature or perceived inconvenience. As a result, a substantial portion of the population, particularly middle-aged and older adults who should undergo regular screening, remains unscreened. Recognizing the urgent need for more accessible and non-invasive screening options, medical researchers have been exploring innovative approaches, with promising results emerging in the realm of blood testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The significance of early detection in colon cancer cannot be overstated, potentially preventing up to 73 percent of related deaths. However, current screening methods, including colonoscopies every ten years or fecal tests every one to three years, present considerable challenges for many individuals. These tests often involve unpleasant procedures or the discomfort of handling fecal samples, contributing to low screening rates. Recognizing these limitations, medical professionals have been eagerly awaiting more patient-friendly alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the blood test. Recent advancements have revealed that colon cancers and large polyps shed DNA fragments into the bloodstream, offering a potential avenue for non-invasive detection. Initial studies, such as one published in The New England Journal of Medicine, have shown promising results for a blood test called Shield, developed by Guardant Health. This test demonstrated an impressive 87 percent accuracy in detecting early-stage cancers, with a manageable false positive rate of 10 percent. The convenience and simplicity of a blood test offer a compelling alternative to conventional screening methods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, while the blood test excels in detecting cancers, it falls short in identifying large polyps, a crucial precursor to cancer development. Unlike fecal tests, which detect 43 percent, or colonoscopies, which detect 94 percent of large polyps, the blood test only identifies 13 percent. This limitation underscores the importance of comprehensive patient education and informed decision-making regarding screening options. Patients must understand the trade-offs between different tests and the necessity of follow-up procedures, such as colonoscopies, in case of abnormal blood test results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Barbara Jung, a prominent figure in gastroenterology, emphasizes the need for thorough patient consultation before opting for a blood test. While the test offers early cancer detection, it does not prevent cancer due to its limited efficacy in detecting precancerous polyps. Primary care physicians play a pivotal role in guiding patients through these discussions, despite time constraints and the multitude of screening recommendations they must manage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, questions remain regarding the optimal frequency of blood testing and its performance in younger populations not eligible for conventional screening methods. Additional studies are needed to assess the test's efficacy and feasibility across diverse demographic groups. Dr. Jung expresses particular concern about the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals, highlighting the potential benefits of early screening in this demographic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One significant factor influencing the adoption of blood testing is its cost. While Guardant Health has sought FDA approval for the test, its current status as a lab-based test poses financial barriers for many patients. At a price of $895, out-of-pocket payment may be prohibitive for some individuals, although negotiations with insurers could lead to more affordable options. Dr. William Grady, a key figure in the trial sponsored by Guardant, suggests that pricing adjustments may align the test's cost with other screening methods, making it accessible to a broader population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, the ease of blood testing offers a compelling advantage over conventional screening methods. Integrating colon cancer screening into routine blood work simplifies the process for both patients and healthcare providers, potentially increasing overall screening rates. Dr. May underscores the significance of this advancement, emphasizing that the best screening test is one that patients complete. By prioritizing accessibility and patient comfort, blood testing represents a promising step towards reducing colon cancer mortality on a population scale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, the development of blood testing for colon cancer detection represents a significant breakthrough in preventive medicine. While challenges remain regarding its efficacy, cost, and integration into existing screening protocols, the potential benefits are undeniable. With ongoing research and collaboration between healthcare professionals, policymakers, and industry stakeholders, blood testing could revolutionize colon cancer screening, saving countless lives in the process. As we navigate the complexities of cancer prevention and early detection, innovation and patient-centered care remain essential pillars of progress in healthcare.</p>d2:Tc05,<p>The United States has issued a stern warning to Austria's top bank, Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI), cautioning it against conducting business with Russia or face severe sanctions. The US Treasury's threat comes amid growing concerns over RBI's alleged involvement in funding Russia's military operations, sparking apprehensions of potential repercussions for the bank's global financial standing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a press release on Thursday, the US Treasury explicitly cautioned RBI of the consequences of aiding Russia's military endeavors, highlighting the risk of being ostracized from the US financial system. This warning was reiterated during discussions between senior Treasury official Anna Morris and RBI executives in Vienna, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While RBI refrained from commenting publicly on the discussions, the bank expressed its commitment to disassociating from Russia's war efforts. Despite being named in Ukraine's list of international "Sponsors of War," RBI affirmed its willingness to engage with Ukrainian authorities to rectify its status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Ukrainian officials remain skeptical of RBI's intentions, emphasizing the bank's significant role as a financial conduit between the EU and Russia. Concerns were raised regarding RBI's ability to mitigate risks and avoid complicity in circumventing sanctions, particularly given its substantial presence in the Russian market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RBI's lucrative operations in Russia, which yielded &euro;1.3 billion in profits last year, have come under scrutiny amidst allegations of involvement in schemes benefiting the Russian military. The bank's participation in initiatives such as the Russian conscripts' loan moratorium has raised ethical and compliance concerns, amplifying calls for accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apart from RBI, other European banks operating in Russia, including Dutch lender ING and German institutions Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank, face similar scrutiny from US authorities. Talks between US Treasury officials and German financiers underscore the heightened regulatory scrutiny facing European banks engaged in Russian transactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the threat of US sanctions looms large, European authorities have refrained from directly challenging the US's jurisdictional overreach, opting instead for a cautious diplomatic approach. The EU's stance on extraterritorial sanctions emphasizes the need for adherence to international law while advocating for the autonomy of EU entities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amidst escalating tensions and regulatory crackdowns, the fate of European banks operating in Russia hangs in the balance, highlighting the complexities of navigating geopolitical risks in the global financial landscape. As RBI and its counterparts grapple with mounting pressure, the specter of US sanctions underscores the imperative of aligning with international sanctions laws to mitigate compliance risks and safeguard financial stability.</p>d3:T997,<h4>Recent research has shed light on the precise number of steps individuals should aim for daily to mitigate the risk of heart disease and premature death. Contrary to the widely promoted goal of achieving 10,000 steps per day, a study suggests that the threshold for health benefits lies above 2,200 steps.</h4>
<h4>Published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine and led by researchers at the University of Sydney, the study analyzed data from 72,174 participants aged approximately 61, gathered from the UK Biobank. After wearing accelerometer devices for seven days, participants' exercise levels were monitored over a seven-year period.</h4>
<h4>The findings revealed a clear correlation between daily step count and health outcomes. Participants who walked between 9,000 and 10,500 steps per day experienced the lowest risk of early mortality. Similarly, individuals managing around 9,700 steps daily demonstrated the lowest risks of stroke and heart attack.</h4>
<h4>Interestingly, the benefits of walking extended beyond mere step count, with individuals experiencing health benefits even if the majority of their day was spent being inactive. However, the study emphasized that the advantages of walking increased proportionally with the number of steps taken.</h4>
<h4>Moreover, a separate study published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry highlighted the significance of even minimal levels of exercise in reducing the risk of stroke. Researchers from Imperial College London NHS Healthcare Trust underscored the importance of encouraging physical activity at all levels.</h4>
<h4>Julie Ward, a senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, emphasized the importance of staying active for heart and circulatory health. She recommended incorporating 150 minutes of moderate exercise into one's weekly routine, advocating for various forms of physical activity tailored to individual lifestyles.</h4>
<h4>In light of these findings, the notion of achieving 10,000 steps daily as a universal benchmark for optimal health is being reconsidered. Instead, individuals are encouraged to prioritize consistent physical activity, recognizing that even incremental increases in daily step count can yield significant health benefits.</h4>
<h4>As researchers continue to explore the relationship between exercise and health outcomes, the message remains clear: every step counts towards a healthier future.</h4>d4:Tde6,<h4 style="text-align: justify;">El Toro, an advertising technology company headquartered in Louisville, KY, has announced the forthcoming launch of its innovative digital advertising portal, Gen3.

The company stated that it is adjusting its focus to prioritize areas with the strongest potential for growth. As a result, Treasury Prime has made the difficult decision to reevaluate its staffing needs.</h4>
<h4><br />In a statement to FinTech Futures, the company expressed its understanding of the impact these adjustments will have on affected employees. Treasury Prime emphasized its commitment to supporting impacted staff through severance packages, continuation of healthcare benefits, and career transition services.</h4>
<h4><br />Established in 2017, Treasury Prime previously offered its BaaS services to fintech companies, allowing them to connect directly with banks using its application programming interfaces (APIs). However, CEO Chris Dean highlighted a shift in the company's strategy towards fostering direct partnerships between banks and fintech firms.</h4>
<h4>Dean explained in a blog post on the company's website that the future of embedded banking lies in bank-direct collaborations with fintech partners. Treasury Prime believes that direct partnerships between banks and fintechs are crucial for meeting the evolving needs of customers in the financial services sector.</h4>
<h4>As part of its new strategic direction, Treasury Prime is launching a Bank-Direct product designed to facilitate the entire lifecycle of direct relationships between banks and fintech customers. This includes sales, onboarding, management, and support of partnerships between the two entities.</h4>
<h4>Despite the shift in focus, Treasury Prime reassured its existing fintech partners that their business operations will remain unaffected. Dean emphasized that the company will continue to support its current fintech clients and is dedicating additional resources to enhance their experience.</h4>
<h4>However, the strategic pivot has led to staffing adjustments within Treasury Prime. Dean acknowledged in his blog post that some employees will either leave the company or be reassigned to other roles within the organization. While the exact number of affected employees has not been disclosed, reports suggest that the staff cuts could impact approximately half of the company's workforce of around 100 employees.</h4>

The lawsuit, filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, accuses Trump's media venture of attempting to dilute Litinsky and Moss's stakes in the company amidst a potential merger.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Litinsky and Moss claim that when they presented the media startup concept to the former president, it was agreed that Trump would receive a 90% stake in the company. In exchange for their efforts in launching the venture, Litinsky, Moss, and a legal representative involved in the deal were promised the remaining 10% stake without any additional compensation.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>However, according to the lawsuit, Trump Media recently sought to significantly reduce UAV's interests by expanding the authorized stock from 120 million shares to one billion shares. The proposed move, described as "11th hour, pre-merger corporate maneuvering," aimed to allocate new shares to Trump and/or his associates and children, thereby diminishing UAV's stake from 8.6% to less than 1%.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Trump Media has yet to respond to requests for comment regarding the allegations.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Litinsky and Moss initially approached Trump with the idea for a Trump-branded media venture in 2021, following Trump's removal from Twitter. Despite their departure from Trump Media, Litinsky and Moss still retain ownership shares in the company.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Meanwhile, Trump Media has been entangled in a protracted merger attempt with Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), a special purpose acquisition company. The merger, announced over two years ago, has faced numerous delays, partly due to an ongoing Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into potential securities violations.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>DWAC shareholders recently granted Trump Media a 12-month extension to finalize the merger, providing the company with $300 million raised from its shareholders for the purpose of the merger. The potential merger, speculated to be worth $4 billion according to The New York Times, could offer President Trump a significant financial boost, particularly as he faces a substantial payment of over $450 million to the state of New York following a civil fraud ruling.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The lawsuit filed by UAV suggests that Trump's rush to expand his stock holdings may be linked to the impending merger, which could serve as a critical liquidity event for Trump amid his financial obligations.</h4>

<p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) is issuing a critical alert about the potential rapid spread of measles, urging immediate action to boost vaccination rates.

The growth, totaling 15.9%, is primarily attributed to a substantial increase in online advertising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Projections now indicate a 6.4% expansion for the entire year of 2023, reaching a total of &pound;37 billion, representing a substantial 3.8 percentage point upgrade from the October 2023 forecast. The final figures for FY 2023 are scheduled for release in late April 2024, and the revised projection for advertising spend in 2024 is &pound;39 billion, showcasing a 5.9% year-on-year increase. This upward trend mirrors the recently released IPA Bellwether figures, emphasizing a decade-high upward revision in UK marketing budgets for 2024.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examining the Q3 2023 results, despite challenging economic conditions, search and online display advertising, including social media, outperformed expectations. Search achieved its strongest performance in 18 months, rising by 23.7%, while online display recorded a 24.8% increase, its highest gain in the same period. In comparison, France experienced approximately 5% online growth during the quarter, while the UK grew 4.6 times faster at 22.3%. Notably, online retailers in the UK increased their ad spend by 156% during Q3 2023, intensifying competition for household budgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other advertising channels also saw growth in Q3 2023, with cinema up by 21.2%, out-of-home by 12.9%, and broadcaster video on-demand (BVOD) spending increasing by 28.4%, partly influenced by on-demand viewing during the Women's FIFA World Cup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2024, further growth in advertising spend across various channels is anticipated. Events such as the Men's Euros, a potential General Election, and continued coverage of the Olympics are expected to contribute positively to this trend. TV advertising is projected to return to positive figures, with a 1.4% year-on-year increase, primarily driven by BVOD (+14.6%). The forecast also predicts a return to growth for radio (+2.1%) and online channels of national newsbrands (+2.1%), regional newsbrands (+1.1%), and magazine media (+2.3%).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephen Woodford, CEO of the Advertising Association, expressed confidence in advertisers' commitment to brand investment despite economic challenges. He highlighted the industry's positive performance, outpacing the broader UK economy, with a forecasted spend of &pound;39 billion in 2024. Woodford emphasized the industry's potential to address economic and social challenges by promoting innovation, stimulating competition, and supporting jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James McDonald, Director of Data, Intelligence &amp; Forecasting at WARC, acknowledged the challenging economic climate but celebrated the online ad sector's robust performance, growing five times faster than in key European markets. McDonald expressed brighter expectations for 2024, fueled by a strong end to the previous year and positive sentiments across the marketing and business sectors.</p>de:T98d,<p>Valvoline Inc.

According to a report from the World Obesity Federation, more than half of the world's population might struggle with obesity by 2035. This makes it crucial to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Farmley's Munchies provide a tasty alternative to traditional snacks without compromising on health.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Crafted with the same dedication as other Farmley products, Munchies are a mix of wholesome and healthy snacking. Unlike regular fried snacks and potato chips cooked in palm oil, Munchies are made from a blend of makhana flour, olive oil, and a carefully selected seasoning mix. They come in two delicious flavors: Masala Munchies and Achaari Munchies, priced at Rs 30 per pack, making the switch to healthy snacking as easy as munching!</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Founder Akash Sharma shared, "Munchies is more than just a snack; it's a commitment to changing how we snack. We're always innovating to create products that blur the line between healthy and tasty. The launch of Munchies is a significant step in this direction as we enter the new year, and we'll keep innovating for wholesome snacking."</h4>

Now, they want a special license that lets them control the whole process themselves. This makes things more efficient and profitable for Fiserv because they don't have to pay a bank to do it.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The CEO of Fiserv, Frank Bisignano, is likely wanting to have more control over the whole process. They acquired First Data in 2019, which used to work with Bank of America, but that partnership ended.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>It's hard for Fiserv to find banks willing to partner with them because it doesn't benefit the banks much. Handling these transactions isn't a core business for banks, and it doesn't make them much money.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In the business of handling transactions for merchants, the profit margins are very small. Without a large scale, it's tough to compete. Fiserv was the biggest non-bank company doing this in 2022, but they want even more control over the process.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>However, Fiserv is clear that they don't plan to become a full-fledged bank. They'll still work with banks that want to be part of the process.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>They are applying for a special license that no one else has. This license allows them to avoid some processes and have direct access to card networks. The Georgia Department of Banking and Finance hasn't accepted or rejected Fiserv's application yet.</h4>e2:T8c7,<h4>The number of veteran-owned small businesses in the United States is declining, posing a challenge as the older generation retires. With nearly 2 million such businesses providing a substantial payroll and employing millions, they are facing a steady decrease, dropping from 11% of small businesses in 2014 to just over 5% in 2021.</h4>
<h4>A significant factor contributing to this decline is a lack of access to capital, with veterans reporting difficulties in obtaining loans due to unfamiliarity with their business models.</h4>
<h4>Despite efforts by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to facilitate lending, the decline persists, affecting post-9/11 veteran business owners more severely. However, there is a positive trend in business ownership among women and minorities, with the SBA actively working to support veteran entrepreneurs through increased outreach and programs.</h4>
<h4>The SBA's recent efforts include expanding veteran business outreach centers and increasing loans to veteran-owned businesses, although challenges still persist, especially in defining specific procedures to give veterans special consideration in lending programs.</h4>
<h4>In a related context, the landscape of medical billing in the U.S. is undergoing significant changes, with a growing majority of debtors now representing individuals with health insurance. Previously, bad debt in hospitals mainly came from those who could afford to pay but chose not to.</h4>
<h4>However, the rise of complex health insurance products with high out-of-pocket costs has shifted this dynamic. The analysis reveals that insured patients now account for over half of hospitals' bad debt, showcasing the challenges posed by insurance plans with substantial out-of-pocket expenses.</h4>
<h4>As medical debt becomes a pressing issue affecting millions of Americans, there is a growing acknowledgment of the impact of high deductibles, particularly in plans like those under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The evolving landscape raises concerns about the effectiveness of current health plans, with ongoing debates on how to address the intricate challenges associated with medical billing and its impact on individuals and healthcare providers.</h4>e3:T10f0,<p>In a significant milestone, LinkedIn recently celebrated reaching a remarkable one billion members, marking its status as the world's largest professional networking platform.

This transformative update is set to redefine how professionals approach their careers in the digital age.</p>
<h2>Personalized Guidance For An Evolving Workplace</h2>
<p>LinkedIn's latest Premium experience addresses the growing skills gap facing today's professionals. The platform's research indicates that 65% of the skills required for various jobs will change by 2030 as workplaces transform rapidly.</p>
<p>With this in mind, LinkedIn's AI assistant analyzes users' activities and interactions, striving to provide them with insightful and actionable recommendations. For instance, it might suggest new skills to acquire, articles to read, or even potential connections to reach out to, all tailored to the unique career context of the user.</p>
<p>This AI-driven assistant is designed to alleviate the burden of sifting through lengthy articles, videos, and posts, offering concise suggestions on how the information can benefit you. In a rapidly evolving professional landscape, this personalized guidance can be invaluable in helping individuals stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<h2>AI-Powered Job Search</h2>

Fueled by OpenAI's GPT-4 language model, this chatbot can assess your profile and work experience to determine your suitability for a particular role.</p>
<p>For Premium users, the chatbot can be activated directly from a job posting, and it can answer questions such as "Am I qualified for this role?" or "How can I best showcase my background?" Examining your profile yields a perceptive evaluation, spotlighting the areas where your prior experience coincides with the job prerequisites while identifying any potential deficiencies that could affect your application.</p>
<p>Erran Berger, LinkedIn's VP of Product Engineering, emphasized the significant investment and effort that went into creating the infrastructure to support this chatbot. He noted, "During these conversational interactions, there are moments when it feels akin to a search &mdash; where you anticipate instant responses. Therefore, we had to develop significant platform capabilities to make this a reality."</p>
<p>The chatbot's introduction is set to simplify and optimize the job search process, making it more efficient and user-friendly. It provides valuable feedback to users, helping them present themselves effectively to potential employers.</p>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>These innovative features come at a time when LinkedIn is aiming to reaccelerate revenue growth following recent slowdowns. A couple of weeks ago, the company announced a reduction in its workforce, primarily in the engineering department. However, with one billion members worldwide, LinkedIn retains its position as the premier professional networking platform.</p>
<p>While these offerings are designed to assist more people in finding suitable job opportunities, they also underscore LinkedIn's dedication to harnessing the power of AI to empower individuals in their professional endeavors. This update demonstrates LinkedIn's commitment to ensuring that AI-driven solutions serve as a valuable resource for its ever-expanding user base.</p>
<p>LinkedIn's AI-powered Premium update signifies a significant step towards enhancing the professional journeys of its members. By offering personalized guidance and a dynamic job search experience, it reaffirms LinkedIn's role as a trailblazer in professional networking and career development. With these innovative tools, professionals can navigate the evolving work landscape with greater confidence and success.</p>e4:T17f2,<p>In a strategic move to address its substantial debt load, Lumen is set to lay off 4% of its workforce, as announced by CEO Kate Johnson during the third-quarter earnings call.</p>
<p>The company currently grapples with nearly $20 billion in debt and aims to optimize its operations and reduce costs significantly.</p>
<p>"We have made the challenging choice to restructure and downsize Lumen with a focus on future growth," stated Johnson. She also mentioned that the restructuring, along with additional optimization initiatives, is expected to generate annualized savings of around $300 million.</p>
<p>Lumen, as of September 30, had approximately 30,000 employees, which means that approximately 1,200 employees will be affected by these layoffs.</p>
<p>In response to this plan, Lumen anticipates incurring severance and related costs in the range of $55 to $65 million, <strong><a title="according to a filing from the company" href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000018926/fb1fdabd-c3d0-4052-b417-cf8571e4924b.pdf">according to a filing from the company</a></strong>. The workforce reduction is anticipated to be "substantially completed" by the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>These layoffs are part of Lumen's broader strategy to reposition the company for growth, which includes restructuring its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The company is also in the process of selling its EMEA business, which is expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in net after-tax proceeds to be used for debt reduction. The sale of a majority of its Content Delivery Network (CDN) contracts to Akamai is another step toward focusing on its core strengths.</p>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>Lumen's future strategy is focused on stemming churn and legacy product revenue declines while evolving new products. The company also plans to continue expanding its fiber presence.</p>
<p>Johnson highlighted that Lumen has seen substantial expansion in Quantum fiber enablement, enabling approximately 141,000 fiber locations during the third quarter. However, subscriber additions this quarter fell short of Lumen's expectations.</p>
<p>At the close of the third quarter, the company had 896,000 fiber broadband customers, marking an increase from 813,000 in the same period of 2022. On the other hand, its non-fiber broadband customer base declined from nearly 2.3 million to 1.9 million.</p>
<p>While Lumen believes that operational improvements contributed to the subscriber addition shortfall, it acknowledges the need to enhance sales and marketing strategies. Given the constraints of the capital environment, Lumen will prioritize sales and marketing investments over enablement growth.</p>

<h2>Analysts' Perspective</h2>
<p>New Street Research suggests that Lumen's challenges are primarily company-specific, indicating that they may not be indicative of broader industry trends.</p>
<h2>Lumen's Focus on New Markets</h2>
<p>In the future, Lumen plans to target new markets, with a particular focus on the digital inclusion market.</p>
<p>Recently, the company secured a significant multi-year deal worth over $400 million with California to help build an open-access network across the state. Lumen aims to replicate this framework in other states to bridge the digital divide.</p>
<h2>Lumen NaaS Expansion</h2>
<p>Lumen is making progress in driving the adoption of its Internet on Demand, a feature of its Network as a Service (NaaS) platform that allows customers to connect to public data centers and port-enabled business locations instantly.</p>
<p>The company has also announced the integration of its NaaS with Equinix Fabric, a global, software-defined interconnection platform, to extend its services to Equinix's 10,000 customers.</p>
<p>This expansion will enable Lumen to offer new services under the NaaS umbrella, including security services such as distributed denial of service (DDoS), secure access service edge (SASE), and edge services.</p>
<h2>Q3 Financials</h2>
<p>In terms of financials, Lumen reported a net loss of $78 million in Q3 2023, compared to a net income of $578 million during the same period in 2022.</p>
<p>Consolidated Q3 revenue of $3.64 billion was in line with industry expectations but down 17% year-on-year from $4.39 billion. Business segment revenue remained relatively stable at $2.89 billion, while Mass Markets revenue decreased by 2% to $747 million.</p>
<p>CFO Chris Stansbury attributed the revenue headwinds to the macro environment and ongoing creditor discussions.</p>
<p>However, he expressed optimism about seeing sustained improving revenue trends in mid-2024. Stansbury also emphasized that the enterprise segment would continue to be a top priority as the company works toward its growth goals.</p>
<p>Lumen's decision to reduce its workforce and undertake other cost-cutting measures is a strategic move aimed at addressing its substantial debt and positioning the company for future growth.</p>
<p>The company's focus on expanding its fiber presence and venturing into new markets, particularly in the digital inclusion sector, reflects its commitment to diversifying its offerings.</p>
<p>Additionally, the integration of its NaaS with Equinix Fabric and plans to offer new services under the NaaS umbrella highlight Lumen's commitment to staying competitive in the evolving telecommunications landscape. While the company faces financial challenges, it remains determined to achieve sustained revenue growth in the coming years.</p>

However, this popular elixir's availability is dwindling, leaving both men and women grappling with the possibility of a bad hair day. </span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This news dives into the growing scarcity of minoxidil, its vital role in combating hair loss, and the concerns raised by experts.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minoxidil: The Lifeline for Thinning Hair</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minoxidil, a pill that promises the resurrection of thinning hair, has become a lifeline for those plagued by androgenetic alopecia, commonly known as male or female pattern hair loss. This condition haunts nearly half of men and a quarter of women by the time they reach 50 years old, according to the <span style="color: #3598db;"><strong><a style="color: #3598db;" title="American Osteopathic College of Dermatology." href="https://www.aocd.org/page/AndrogeneticAlopecia">American Osteopathic College of Dermatology.</a></strong></span></span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Peril of Interruption</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The magic of minoxidil lies in its consistency. Patients must take it daily to maintain the progress they've made in restoring hair growth. Dr. Adam Friedman, a distinguished professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University, warns, "You can go backward and start losing your hair again." The interruption of this regimen can be devastating.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Dearth in Pharmacies</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recent research highlights a disturbing trend: minoxidil is becoming increasingly challenging to procure from local pharmacies. Dr. Friedman and his colleagues embarked on a mission earlier this month, calling 277 pharmacies across the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia to investigate the status of minoxidil supplies. Their findings were disheartening.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Alarming Shortages</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Out of the 277 pharmacies surveyed, only 40% could immediately fulfill 30-day prescriptions for minoxidil, particularly in the 2.5-milligram dosage commonly used for hair loss treatment. The distressing shortage of this vital drug has been documented in the Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, raising concern among experts.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Mystery of the Shortage</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cause of this scarcity remains to be discovered. Dr. Friedman couldn't pinpoint a definitive reason for the shortage but noted that minoxidil's growing popularity, fueled by both mainstream and social media, might have triggered an increase in prescriptions. </span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The exact waiting time for patients in need of their medication was not determined, and the researchers didn't inquire about the pharmacies' restocking timelines.</span></h4>

<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Looming Crisis</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the uncertainty surrounding the shortage's root cause and duration, Dr. Friedman remains deeply concerned about the potential consequences: "A substantial number of our patients are not going to be able to access minoxidil because of these shortages," he stressed. "It's a significant problem."</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unraveling the Minoxidil Miracle</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minoxidil's journey from a blood pressure medication to a hair regrowth miracle is a fascinating tale. Originally developed in the 1960s to treat high blood pressure by dilating blood vessels, it revealed an unexpected side effect&mdash;excessive hair growth. </span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Though the exact mechanism of how minoxidil stimulates hair growth remains a mystery, doctors believe it enhances blood circulation around hair follicles.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Hair-Raising Transformation</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By the late 1980s, minoxidil made its way into topical hair loss treatments like Rogaine. However, over time, experts discovered that applying the treatment topically was less effective compared to taking it orally. </span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When ingested, minoxidil possesses the power to stimulate hair growth not only on the scalp but throughout the body, including the chin and arms. For some patients, particularly women, this unintended effect may not be desirable.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Game Changer in Hair Loss Treatment</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Loren Krueger, an assistant professor in the dermatology department at Emory University School of Medicine, hails oral minoxidil as a "game changer" in the realm of hair loss treatment and restoration. She emphasizes that the medication carries low risks and offers high rewards, making it an attractive option for those seeking to combat hair loss.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Tackling the Minoxidil Shortages</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The predicament of obtaining oral minoxidil, which is not FDA-approved for hair loss treatment, might be a regional issue rather than a nationwide crisis. While the FDA does not officially list minoxidil as a drug in short supply, isolated shortages have been reported anecdotally over the past year.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Michael Ganio, the senior director of pharmacy practice and quality for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, suggests that it's common for outlets to run out of 30-day supplies of minoxidil occasionally. </span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given that the drug is primarily meant for managing high blood pressure and is not typically required in emergencies, pharmacies usually keep minimal stock. Wholesalers can typically replenish the drug within days, but if patients need it urgently, they might have to explore multiple pharmacies.</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Impact on Quality of Life</span></h4>
<h4><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hair loss, while not life-threatening, has a profound impact on one's quality of life.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another exciting project in the pipeline involves the development of a tool that will cut, core, and scoop avocados with precision. Mr. Niccol mentioned that this technology saves valuable time but also eliminates the less desirable aspects of food preparation. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Importantly, it still allows Chipotle's skilled staff to add their unique touches, such as chopped onions, jalapenos, cilantro, and their signature guacamole, seasoned with citrus and salt and hand-mashed to perfection.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Mr. Niccol explained, "Our team is passionate about delivering the best food experience, and this technology will free them from some of the more tedious tasks, ensuring that they can focus on what they love most &ndash; crafting exceptional dishes for our customers."</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Road to Implementation</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While these advancements are incredibly promising, they are still in the experimental phase and require further development and iterations before they can be implemented across <span style="color: #3598db;"><strong><a style="color: #3598db;" title="Chipotle restaurants" href="https://www.chipotle.com/home">Chipotle restaurants</a></strong></span>. </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By automating certain processes, Chipotle aims to maintain operational efficiency while continuing to provide high-quality, freshly prepared food.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Impressive Financial Results</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These groundbreaking developments come on the heels of impressive financial results. Chipotle reported a net income of $313.22 million for the third quarter, marking a 22% increase compared to the previous year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Total revenue also saw a significant boost, rising by 11% to reach $2.47 billion. This growth was driven by a 5% increase in comparable restaurant sales, attributed to higher transaction volumes and an increase in the average check.</span></p>

<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Disconnect in Search Engine Results</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The typical scenario for internet users is one where search results only sometimes reflect the latest changes on a website. This discrepancy occurs because search engines often need to be more aware of when and where a site's content has been altered. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As a result, they incessantly crawl the web to catch up with the updates. Unfortunately, this not only consumes the bandwidth of website owners but also prevents search engines from focusing on genuinely updated content.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This lack of real-time updates can be frustrating for both businesses and consumers. It limits the ability to obtain timely and relevant search results, which is crucial in today's fast-paced digital world.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A New Era for Advertisers</span></h2>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Netflix's Leap into Sports</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most exciting developments is the Netflix Cup. This event pits Formula 1 drivers from the acclaimed "Drive to Survive" documentary series against PGA golfers in a thrilling match-play golf tournament. Scheduled for November 14, the Netflix Cup is set to captivate a diverse audience, with T-Mobile and Nespresso on board as sponsors.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Novel Approach to Advertising</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Netflix will launch a groundbreaking binge ad format later this year. This format will allow brands to showcase 30- or 60-second brand spots during a viewer's binge-watching session before a commercial-free episode. This strategic move aims to reward viewers and help brands truly stand out.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Power of Top 10 Ads</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In addition to these innovative ad formats, Netflix offers the "Top 10" ad format, allowing brands to place their media in the most-watched shows on the platform. These top placements appear on the interface near the "For You" and "Keep Watching" sections, providing advertisers a prime opportunity to connect with audiences.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Quest for Cultural Relevance</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Peter Naylor emphasized the importance of cultural relevance in advertising. He stated, "Advertisers tell me all the time they want to be culturally relevant and have the ability to connect with audiences. To achieve cultural relevance, there's no more effective way than embedding your advertisements in the most buzzed-about top shows."</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Live Sports and Holistic Integration</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By sponsoring the Netflix Cup, brands can effectively reach out to both racing and golf enthusiasts as <span style="color: #3598db;"><strong><a style="color: #3598db;" title="Netflix" href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a></strong></span> takes its first step into live sports. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The sponsorships are set to be seamlessly integrated into the broadcasts, offering the audience a natural and holistic experience. Notably, this approach will avoid traditional 15- and 30-second ads, creating a more immersive experience.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For Nespresso, this sponsorship opportunity represents a significant step in "household penetration build mode."

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She added, "What better way to do it than with something that's the first time and exciting and a cultural moment that we can associate ourselves with in a way that just introduces people to a different side [of the brand] than they expected."</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This groundbreaking announcement comes on the eve of Netflix's fiscal third-quarter earnings report.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The departure of Netflix's global ad president, Jeremi Gorman, earlier this month marked a significant change in the company's leadership. Amy Reinhard, previously Vice President of Netflix's studio operations, has stepped into this crucial role.</span></p>

<p>The prospect of higher interest rates notably bolstered this surge of interest in the financial sector.</p>
<p>European bank stocks experienced a rollercoaster ride, dipping by as much as 4% at one point last month, only to stage a remarkable recovery, closing September with an impressive gain of 2.6%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their counterparts in the United States witnessed a less favorable outcome, ending the month with a 3% decline.</p>
<p>The backdrop for this financial sector frenzy can be attributed to a whirlwind of central bank rate hikes spanning over two years.</p>
<p>These rate hikes have breathed new life into financial companies, offering them higher profits. This comes after a decade of low interest rates and modest growth that had cast a shadow on their profit margins.</p>
<p>Hedge funds, sensing the winds of change, began accumulating long positions in European banks, insurance companies, and capital market firms as early as August, with their investments reaching a 12-month peak by September 21st, according to the report by Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>In the case of North American financial stocks, hedge funds began the last week of September with relatively low exposure.</p>
<p>However, they swiftly increased their holdings by the week's end, as revealed in a separate note released by Morgan Stanley's prime brokerage on October 2nd.</p>
<p>The note highlights an interesting trend: "Those areas of the market where hedge fund ownership was lightest entering the week ultimately ended up as the most net bought."</p>
<p>According to the bank's analysis, this phenomenon was not limited to the financial sector alone but extended to industrial and energy stocks.</p>
<p>While hedge funds have been increasingly bullish on financials, it's worth noting that both long and short exposures to European stocks, for both U.S. and European hedge funds, remain at relatively low levels. U.S.-based managers' holdings of European equities need to catch up to historical levels.</p>
<p>Similarly, European hedge funds have maintained positions in Europe that are near their lowest levels since 2010, as highlighted by Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Interestingly, European hedge funds seem to have a higher affinity for companies listed in the United States and various Asian countries, excluding Japan. This international diversification reflects their strategy for navigating the global financial landscape.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, one of the leading providers of lending and trading services to hedge funds, stands at the forefront of tracking these investment trends.</p>
<p>As the financial sector adapts to changing interest rate dynamics, industry experts and investors will undoubtedly closely watch hedge funds' moves in the market. The financial sector dynamics appear poised for further evolution in the coming months, making it an area of great interest and speculation in the investment world.</p>
<p>The financial sector's response to rising interest rates and the enthusiasm of global hedge funds provide an intriguing glimpse into the evolving landscape of international finance.</p>
<p>As we move forward, the world will be watching to see how these trends shape the future of the financial industry.</p>ea:T10d3,<p>The US Department of Justice raised objections on Monday regarding the exclusion of the public from certain discussions in the court about Google's pricing of online advertising. This issue lies at the core of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington.</p>
<p>The government aims to prove that Alphabet's Google violated antitrust laws to maintain its dominant position in online search. Google's dominance in search has led to a significant increase in advertising revenue, propelling the company to a valuation of $1 trillion.</p>
<p>David Dahlquist, speaking on behalf of the government, highlighted a redacted document that included a brief exchange about Google's pricing for <span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong><a style="color: #236fa1;" title="search advertising" href="https://www.meetsoci.com/resources/blog/advertising/search-advertising">search advertising</a></strong></span>.</p>
<p>Dahlquist argued before Judge Amit Mehta, who will make the final decision in the case, that information like this should not be redacted. He stated that it is of public interest as it forms a crucial part of the DOJ's case against Google.</p>
<p>Representing Google, John Schmidtlein requested that discussions about pricing be conducted in closed sessions, which would require excluding the public and reporters from the courtroom.</p>
<p>Redacting information related to market share, business strategies, and pricing is not uncommon in merger trials. Katherine Van Dyck, a seasoned litigator and senior legal counsel at the American Economic Liberties Project, explained that companies often prefer to keep such information hidden, while government lawyers focused on winning the case may not prioritize over-sealing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Also Read, <a title="U.S. Antitrust Regulator to Target Amazon's Marketplace - Bloomberg Reports" href="../../../retail/us-antitrust-target-amazon-marketplace">U.S. Antitrust Regulator to Target Amazon's Marketplace - Bloomberg Reports</a></strong></span></p>
<p>Van Dyck's organization advocated for the trial to be conducted through telephone lines, as was done for pre-trial hearings due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>However, Judge Mehta denied this motion. Van Dyck believes that the judge's decision was misguided, asserting that courts need to adapt their rules and keep up with modern technology, especially in cases of significant public interest.</p>
<p>For example, a Verizon executive named Brian Higgins testified to the company's decision to pre-install Google's Chrome browser with Google Search on its mobile phones.</p>
<p>Although Higgins' testimony lasted for approximately 30 minutes, it was closed to the public for the following two hours. It remains uncertain whether he was questioned about Google's payments to Verizon as the details were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The government claims that these annual payments amount to $10 billion, benefiting Google with prominent default positions on smartphones and other devices.</p>
<p>Throughout the trial, Google's defense hinges on the argument that its substantial market share is a result of the quality of its product, rather than any illegal activities aimed at monopolizing certain aspects of its business.</p>
<p>The outcome of this antitrust battle could fundamentally impact the future of the internet, currently dominated by four major players that have faced scrutiny from Congress and antitrust enforcers since the Trump administration. Companies, including Google and Amazon.com, have defended themselves by emphasizing the free or affordable nature of their services.</p>
<p>If Google is found guilty of breaking the law, Judge Mehta, presiding over the case, will determine the appropriate resolution. This could involve ordering Google to cease the identified illegal practices or potentially forcing the company to sell certain assets.</p>

<p>This historic library in Warren County, Virginia, finds itself embroiled in a heated dispute centered around the presence of children's books featuring LGBTQ characters and themes.</p>
<p>The conflict, which echoes similar debates in libraries across the country, takes a unique turn in Front Royal due to a potentially severe consequence.</p>
<p>In June, the Warren County Board of Supervisors decided to withhold 75% of the library's funding unless significant revisions are made to the library board's bylaws, providing the county with more influence over its governance.</p>
<p>The Samuels Public Library, structured as a nonprofit organization and relying heavily on county funding, has indicated that it is at risk of depleting its operational funds by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Melody Hotek, the President of the library's board of trustees, and Eileen Grady, the library's interim director, have pointed to a small group of activists as the driving force behind the county's actions.</p>
<p>These activists vehemently oppose children's literature featuring gay, lesbian, or transgender characters, characterizing such books as "pornographic."</p>
<p>Grady emphasized the origin of the dispute, stating, "This whole fight started over LGBTQ in the library."</p>
<p>Efforts to engage with the five-member Board of Supervisors have yielded limited responses. One of the supervisors, Walter Mabe, expressed optimism about resolving the issue through discussions and adjustments. However, Hotek cautioned that time and financial resources are running out.</p>

<p>Members of the library board and the Board of Supervisors are currently engaged in ongoing discussions, exchanging various proposals to alter the library board's governance. The hotel remains "cautiously optimistic" that a resolution can be achieved.</p>
<p>A community group known as "Clean Up Samuels" has emerged as a prominent force advocating for change within the library. One of its members, Thomas Hinnant, contends that the primary issue is the library board's accountability to the taxpayers who provide the majority of its funding.</p>
<p>"It's about self-rule," Hinnant asserted, emphasizing that the books are a catalyst for highlighting the library's out-of-touch curation policies.<br />Complaints against specific books have surged, partly driven by a controversial event called the "Beer, Babysitting, and Cleaning Up the Samuels Library" party hosted by Clean Up Samuels. Attendees were encouraged to submit challenges to books in the library's collection.</p>
<p>The complaints encompass a wide range of titles, from "<span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong><a style="color: #236fa1;" title="Gender Queer,&quot; a graphic novel" href="https://apnews.com/article/most-challenged-books-2022-list-c39af4320afb16525cb0fd911c9ffed4">Gender Queer," a graphic novel</a></strong></span> with explicit content, to "Bathe the Cat," a children's book depicting a family with two dads. The latter book, while not explicit, introduces children to transgender topics.</p>
<p>Save Samuels, a community group advocating for the library's preservation, maintains that most Warren County residents oppose censorship of LGBTQ-themed books.</p>
<p>Kelsey Lawrence, one of the organizers of Save Samuels, believes the censorship debate is a facade for a broader agenda. "I believe they are employing the 'protecting children' narrative as a smokescreen to conceal their opposition to LGBTQ books in the library," Lawrence commented.</p>
<p>Hotel and Grady have made efforts to address community concerns. Books referencing sexuality in any way have been relocated to a separate section labeled "new adult," and parents can place restrictions on their children's library cards.</p>
<p>Founded in 1799, the Samuels Public Library is the second oldest in Virginia. Despite its historical significance, it operates independently from county government while relying on an annual allocation of $1 million from Warren County, which constitutes 75% of its budget.</p>

<p>While challenges to books occur in libraries nationwide, Lisa Varga, the Executive Director of the Virginia Library Association, noted the unique nature of the threat to the library's funding in Warren County. She praised Save Samuels for their efforts in rallying support, emphasizing that people want the freedom to decide about library books.</p>
<p>"It's only when a situation reaches a critical point, like in Front Royal, that you witness this level of public outcry," Varga concluded.</p>
<p>In this unfolding saga, the future of the Samuels Public Library hangs in the balance as the community grapples with issues of governance, censorship, and the role of libraries in serving diverse populations.</p>ec:T193c,<p>In recent years, the marketing world has witnessed a significant transformation with the rise of influencers.

<p>According to data from OnlyAccounts.io, brands have poured an astonishing $90 billion into influencer advertisements over the past five years. This staggering figure underscores the immense potential and effectiveness of influencer marketing.</p>
<h2>A 400% Surge in Ad Spending since 2017</h2>
<p>So, why have brands embraced influencer advertising with such enthusiasm? The answer lies in its effectiveness. Influencers have cultivated devoted followings, fostering a genuine connection with their audiences.</p>
<p>This deep rapport allows them to boost brand awareness, extend reach, drive traffic, increase sales, and enhance engagement.</p>
<p>Moreover, influencer campaigns benefit from precise targeting and meticulous <strong><a title="performance monitoring" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/performance-monitoring#:~:text=Performance%20monitoring%20involves%20the%20measurement,key%20performance%20indicators%20(KPIs).">performance monitoring</a></strong>, delivering a higher return on investment.</p>
<p>The "State of Influencer Marketing 2023" report indicates that around 40% of brands collaborate with as many as 10 influencers. This trend is fueled by the remarkable returns and increased trust that influencers bring to the table.</p>
<p>As a result, ad spending in this dynamic sector has witnessed an exponential surge over the past half-decade. In 2017, brands and companies allocated roughly $6 billion to influencer advertising, as per Statista. Fast forward to 2020, and this figure has soared to over $16 billion.</p>
<p><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>Also Read, </strong><a style="color: #236fa1;" title="Brands Spent $673 Billion on Social Media Ads in Five Years" href="../../../digital-marketing/brands-spent-673-billion-on-social-media-ads-in-five-years"><strong>Brands Spent $673 Billion on Social Media Ads in Five Years</strong></a></span></p>
<p>The most significant growth was recorded in 2021, with annual spending on influencer ads leaping by nearly 40% to reach $22.3 billion.</p>
<p>Even in the face of a maturing market, companies and brands invested $26.3 billion in influencer advertising last year. Statista's projections indicate an anticipated 17% increase in 2023, pushing the spending threshold to a staggering $30.8 billion.</p>
<p>This phenomenal growth represents a 400% increase in influencer ad spending since 2017. Looking ahead, it's estimated that by 2027, the total ad spending in the influencer market will approach a monumental $48 billion.</p>
<h2>Global Dominance: China, US, and UK Lead the Way</h2>
<p>While influencer marketing has a global footprint, the lion's share of ad spending hails from just three countries: China, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>China, in particular, stands out as the world's largest and fastest-growing influencer advertising market. Between 2017 and 2022, Chinese brands invested a staggering $49 billion in this form of advertising, eclipsing all other nations. Statista's projections suggest that this figure will rise by an additional $16.7 billion in 2023.</p>
<p>In the United States, the second-largest influencer marketing market globally, brands are poised to spend nearly $5 billion in 2023 after investing $15.7 billion over the past five years.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom follows closely behind, with a five-year spending total of $2.8 billion and an additional $1 billion expected this year.<br />The statistics paint a clear picture: These three countries collectively account for two-thirds of total ad spending in the influencer advertising industry. Their influence and investments in this burgeoning sector continue to shape the future of marketing worldwide.</p>
<p>Influencer marketing has transcended mere trend status to become a driving force in the advertising industry. With billions of dollars invested and exponential growth predicted, it's evident that influencers are here to stay.</p>
<p>As brands seek innovative ways to engage audiences, the symbiotic relationship between influencers and marketers will continue to flourish, ushering in a new era of advertising.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Anchorage, revolves around the administration's move to reverse an approach initiated by former President Donald Trump. This policy had opened up extensive portions of the Tongass National Forest, one of the largest wilderness areas in the United States, to logging and mining activities.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Fight Over the Tongass National Forest</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Tongass National Forest, located in southeastern Alaska, is a vast and ecologically significant expanse of land. Covering approximately 16.7 million acres, it is often referred to as the "crown jewel" of the National Forest System. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The dispute stems from President Biden's January decision, made through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), to reinstate protections for 9.37 million acres of this pristine wilderness.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alaska's Economic Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The state of Alaska's lawsuit argues that this decision jeopardizes its economy. The USDA's move threatens to reduce state tax revenues and increase the financial burden on remote communities near the forest by prohibiting timber harvests and mining for essential minerals in the Tongass. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, it hinders economic development in the region.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Legal Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the central claims in Alaska's lawsuit is that the <strong><a title="USDA" href="https://www.usda.gov/">USDA</a></strong> failed to provide adequate justification for its decision, violating federal law. The USDA had not responded to these allegations at the time of the case. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Alaska also asserts that the reversal goes against the Alaska Statehood Act, which transferred significant federal land to the state to support its economic self-sufficiency.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Roadless Rule and Environmental Concerns</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under the USDA's decision, the Tongass National Forest is again subject to the 2001 Roadless Rule. This rule prohibits road construction and timber harvesting in protected and undeveloped areas of U.S. forests. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The USDA justified this move as a necessary step in combatting climate change, as the Tongass Forest acts as a substantial carbon sink, absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Policy Reversed</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It's worth noting that the protections removed in 2020 during the Trump administration's tenure were seen as efforts to ease environmental regulations that hindered industrial activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawsuit filed by Alaska seeks to invalidate the repeal and block the administration from applying the Roadless Rule to the Tongass National Forest.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Broader Environmental Actions</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Tongass National Forest is not the only environmental issue at play in Alaska. The U.S. Interior Department recently announced the cancellation of oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These leases, acquired by an Alaska state development agency during the final days of the Trump presidency, were seen as a threat to the region's wildlife, including polar bears and caribou. President Biden's administration has pledged to protect this 19.6 million-acre refuge.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The legal battle between Alaska and the Biden administration highlights the complexities of balancing economic interests with environmental concerns. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fate of the Tongass National Forest and other environmental policies in Alaska hangs in the balance, as the courts will ultimately decide the outcome of this dispute.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Reports of these problems began surfacing around midday, leaving users frustrated and disconnected from their loved ones and colleagues. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The primary source for monitoring such issues, <strong><a title="Downdetector" href="https://downdetector.co.uk/status/vodafone/">Downdetector</a></strong>, quickly lit up with complaints from affected individuals.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Initial Reports and Network Responses</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vodafone, one of the major players in the UK's telecom industry, swiftly responded to the situation. They reassured their customer base that their network had no discernible issues. However, there was a catch &ndash; customers could not connect with EE numbers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other side of the spectrum, EE, another renowned mobile network provider, apologized to its users, acknowledging their inconvenience. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A spokesperson for EE expressed their commitment to resolving the problem with urgency, stating, "We're aware that some of our mobile customers are unable to make or receive calls from a Vodafone number. We're working quickly to resolve this and are very sorry for any inconvenience caused."</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">EE also asserted that this issue was isolated to calls between the two networks and didn't impact other essential services, such as mobile data and text messaging.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Differing Accounts</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, the accounts provided by <strong>Vodafone and EE</strong> slightly differed. Vodafone customers had registered their grievances on problem-tracking sites and social media, notably on Twitter. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While Vodafone maintained no glitches, it acknowledged that the problem originated from the EE network. The issues were affecting current EE customers and those who had previously switched from EE to Vodafone. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This was due to the intricate way mobile numbers are managed, as three digits of the mobile number still identified them as "EE" numbers, leading to routing problems through EE's infrastructure.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The consequences were evident: though these former EE customers could call within their new network, reaching out to other networks faced disruptions directly linked to the ongoing issues at EE.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Continuing Customer Frustrations</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the evening wore on, frustrated customers from both <strong>Vodafone</strong> and <strong>EE</strong> continued to voice their concerns on social media platforms, particularly on X. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This outpouring of dissatisfaction serves as a stark reminder of the critical role mobile networks play in our daily lives, as their interruptions can disrupt not just personal communication but also business operations and emergency services.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">O2 Customers Also Experience Glitches</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To add to the turmoil, O2 customers reported issues on Downdetector, although O2 denied experiencing any network problems. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, they acknowledged that some users might face difficulties when communicating with EE customers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This unexpected network disruption has brought to light the fragility of our modern digital connections. As mobile networks work diligently to resolve the issue and restore seamless communication, it is a stark reminder of our reliance on technology daily. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the situation continues evolving, users must stay informed through official network updates.</span></p>

<p><strong>What caused the network issues between Vodafone and EE?</strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Calls from these customers were briefly routed through EE's infrastructure due to how mobile numbers are managed, causing disruptions.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The mobile network providers are working diligently to resolve the problem quickly, but the exact timeline is unclear.</span></p>

This challenge becomes especially pronounced when dealing with a world as rich and unbelievable as that of "One Piece."</p>
<p>As the popular series finally drops anchor on Netflix, fans are eager to witness the adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece. However, the real question emerges - how do you bring to life a universe filled with enigmatic Devil Fruits that grant unique superpowers?</p>
<p>While "Cowboy Bebop" successfully transitioned to the streaming platform in 2021, it featured a cast of normal humans and a sci-fi backdrop.</p>
<p>"<strong>One Piece</strong>," on the other hand, explores the high seas with a crew of characters, some of whom are far from ordinary due to the mystical Devil Fruits scattered throughout its world. These fruits offer incredible abilities but come at a price - the inability to swim.</p>
<p>Protagonist Monkey D. Luffy, portrayed by I&ntilde;aki Godoy in the Netflix adaptation, consumed the Gum-Gum Fruit, bestowing him the power to stretch his body in extraordinary ways. However, bringing Luffy's unique abilities to life presented a formidable challenge for director Marc Jobst and his team.</p>
<p>We held numerous meetings on this," Jobst disclosed. "We conducted extensive testing and engaged in numerous discussions to unravel how it functions. Does his hair spread apart when he stretches? What happens to his pores? Do his clothes stretch with him? We tested countless scenarios. Ultimately, you've just got to go with what looks right."</p>

<p>Though delightful in comics and cartoons, stretching powers prove to be an intricate puzzle in live-action. Disney's "Ms. Marvel" series notably altered Kamala Khan's powers for this very reason. For the "One Piece" team, the solution lay in synchronizing the camera's movements with Luffy's stretches.</p>
<p>Fueled by dreams of becoming the King of the Pirates, Luffy names his moves with a grandeur befitting his ambitions. The Gum-Gum Pistol is a basic attack where he stretches his arm backward and delivers a powerful punch, and the Gum-Gum Whip is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Jobst clarified, "When dealing with Morgan, our focus was on harnessing the camera to capture the intensity of his actions.</p>
<p>For the Gum-Gum Whip scene, we positioned the camera on Morgan and Zoro, utilizing a mechanism to swiftly move Morgan out of the frame when the action occurred."</p>
<p>But the challenges didn't end with Luffy. Enter Buggy the Clown, portrayed by Jeff Ward, who devoured the Chop-Chop Fruit, allowing him to split his body and manipulate limbs individually. Defeating him was a nightmare for both the characters and the filmmakers.</p>
<p>"We told the designers to go bonkers and come up with something glorious and mad, and then we'd figure out how to do it," Jobst says, tackling Buggy's unique abilities.</p>
<p>The battle with Buggy involved inventing prosthetics, including a white glove with green-screen capabilities, allowing for limb manipulation without revealing the rest of the body.</p>
<p>The team went further by employing prosthetic limbs on sticks to achieve a dynamic range of limb movement, enhancing the physicality of the action sequences.</p>
<p>Despite the complexities of visual effects, what truly captivated Jobst was the depth of the characters themselves.</p>
<p>"You can have all the visual effects and pyrotechnics, but nobody cares if you don't have a believable, authentic performance in the center of your frame," Jobst notes. "All these actors have delivered something committed and heartfelt."</p>
<p>In an exclusive clip, viewers can taste these dedicated performances as Luffy and his fledgling crew plot their course in the world of pirates. The first season of <strong><a title="One Piece is now streaming on Netflix" href="https://www.netflix.com/in/title/80217863">One Piece is now streaming on Netflix</a></strong>, promising an adventure as expansive as the Grand Line.</p>
<p>As fans embark on this new journey, they can rest assured that the spirit of "One Piece" remains alive, even in the face of Devil Fruit challenges.</p>

Testosterone, often associated with masculinity, vigour, and vitality, takes center stage in this narrative. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recent research has shed new light on the complex interplay of factors influencing testosterone levels, particularly in older men.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Age-Old Question</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Traditionally, it was believed that men's testosterone levels remained relatively stable. However, a new study suggests that after reaching the age of 70, production of this vital hormone begins to decline. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This discovery raises a fundamental question: Is this decline in testosterone an inevitable consequence of the natural aging process, or are other underlying health factors at play?</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Culprits Behind Testosterone Decline</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to investigators, the answer may lie in a combination of factors. While aging certainly plays a role, several other health issues contribute to lower testosterone levels among older men. These factors include obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and marital status.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Impact of Testosterone Loss</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When testosterone levels drop, they can significantly impact a man's overall health and well-being. </span></p>
<p><strong>Some of the consequences of decreased testosterone levels include:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Increased Weakness and Fatigue</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Diminished Sexual Performance</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Loss of Muscle Mass</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Higher Risk for Diabetes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Higher Risk for Dementia</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These effects can profoundly impact a man's quality of life, emphasizing the importance of understanding the factors that influence testosterone levels in aging men.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unraveling the Mysteries</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To unravel the mysteries surrounding testosterone decline in older men, study author Bu Yeap and his team conducted a comprehensive analysis of 11 studies involving over 25,000 men from Australia, Europe, and North America. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These studies, conducted before 2020, consistently showed that, on average, testosterone levels are lower in older men than their younger counterparts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, the analysis also revealed an interesting twist. Another hormone, LH (luteinizing hormone), responsible for increasing testosterone levels, was found to rise after age 70. This suggests that age-related testosterone decline is relatively modest and that other factors play a more substantial role.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Role of Lifestyle and Health</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The study identified a range of other factors contributing to testosterone decline after the age of 70. These factors included heart disease, smoking history, cancer, high blood pressure, excess body weight, reduced physical activity, and marital status. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Notably, being overweight or obese was strongly associated with lower testosterone levels, even more so than age alone.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Marriage Mystery</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, the study suggested that marriage and long-term relationships may also have a testosterone-dampening effect among seniors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While this finding opens doors to intriguing questions about the impact of stress on hormone levels, further research is needed to explore this aspect fully.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Holistic Approach</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In light of these findings, it's clear that testosterone levels in men are influenced by a complex web of sociodemographic, lifestyle, and medical factors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Doctors need to consider these factors when interpreting testosterone results for individual patients. Lower testosterone levels may be attributed to these conditions rather than being an age-related issue.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Seeking Solutions</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dr. Robert Eckel, a respected authority in the medical field, emphasized the complexity of understanding testosterone production dynamics. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He highlighted two potential critical factors: LH levels and the role of <strong><a title="sex hormone-binding globulin" href="https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=167&amp;ContentID=shbg_blood">sex hormone-binding globulin</a></strong> (SHBG) in transporting testosterone throughout the body. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A drop in either of these factors could lead to lower testosterone levels, which can significantly impact a man's well-being.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Given the potential consequences of lower testosterone levels on a man's quality of life, older individuals are encouraged to consult their doctors. Testosterone supplementation therapy should only be considered when there is a clear medical indication and should always be conducted under medical supervision.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In conclusion, the mysteries of testosterone levels in aging men are complex and multifaceted. While age plays a role, a wide range of factors can influence testosterone levels, underscoring the need for a holistic approach to men's health as they age. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understanding these factors empowers individuals and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and optimize the well-being of men in their golden years.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The <strong><a title="announcement was made by C6" href="https://www.c6bank.com.br/blog/jpmorgan-chase-aumenta-participacao-no-c6-bank-para-46">announcement was made by C6</a></strong> on Tuesday, marking a significant development in the ongoing partnership between the two financial giants. While the exact financial terms of this investment remain undisclosed, it underscores the growing importance of digital banking in the global financial sector.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Steady Climb: C6's Remarkable Growth</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Since June 2021, when JPMorgan initially invested in C6, the Brazilian neobank has witnessed a remarkable surge in its client base. In just over two years, the number of customers has catapulted from 8 million to an impressive 25 million, demonstrating the bank's ability to resonate with the evolving financial needs of Brazilians.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This surge in clientele has not occurred in isolation; C6 has consistently expanded its range of financial products and services during this period. Among the notable additions are auto loans, contributing to the diversification of its offerings. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Furthermore, C6's credit portfolio has surged from 9.5 billion Brazilian reals (equivalent to $1.96 billion) to a substantial 40 billion reals ($8.2 billion), marking a substantial growth in lending activities.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Sanoke Viswanathan, the head of strategy and growth, as well as the CEO of international retail banking at JPMorgan, expressed enthusiasm for this collaboration in a prepared statement, saying, "Our strategic investment in C6 Bank is an important part of JPMorgan Chase's global digital banking strategy." </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He further emphasized the success of C6 Bank's approach, highlighting the rapid growth in customers, products, and balance sheet. "We are happy to reinforce our commitment to this partnership," Viswanathan added.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While 2023 hasn't seen many acquisitions, JPMorgan has made noteworthy moves.

It's poised to expand further, with a predicted 10.2% increase in spending in 2023 and 10.5% in 2024. By 2024, it's estimated that retail media will account for 13.6% of all ad spending, a whopping $141.7 billion. </span></p>

This report adds to a series of similar infections that have occurred since May, sending shockwaves through the region's health authorities.</p>
<p>The individual affected by this rare case had not ventured beyond the borders of the United States recently, as confirmed by the Maryland Department of Health in a recent statement. The patient was promptly admitted to the hospital and is currently in the process of recovery.</p>
<p>According to Dr. David Blythe, the director of the health department's infectious disease division, the patient, who hails from the D.C. area, she sought medical attention after experiencing symptoms like fever and excessive sweating.</p>
<p>Remarkably, it has been four decades since Maryland last witnessed a case of locally acquired malaria. State Health Department Secretary Laura Herrera Scott emphasized the significance of this development, marking it as a rare occurrence in the region.</p>
<p>In the United States, more than 2,000 malaria cases are reported annually. However, most cases involve individuals who contracted the disease while traveling abroad.</p>

<p>Malaria, typically associated with mosquito-infested regions of developing nations, had been almost entirely eradicated from the United States by 1951.<br />The alarm bells started ringing when seven cases of locally acquired malaria surfaced in Florida and one point in Texas, all since May.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported these cases in June. Notably, according to the CDC, there is no apparent link between the Florida cases and the isolated Texas infection. Maryland health officials have also confirmed that the patient, in this instance, had not traveled to either of those states.</p>
<p>It's crucial to note that malaria remains a relatively rare occurrence within the United States. With proper treatment, the risk of fatality is significantly reduced, as affirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<strong><a title="CDC" href="https://www.cdc.gov/index.htm">CDC</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Dr. Blythe has suggested the possibility that the Maryland patient contracted the infection from a mosquito that had previously bitten an infected traveler. Investigations are currently underway to determine the exact source of transmission.</p>
<p>In her statement on Friday, Secretary Herrera Scott underscored the seriousness with which the Health Department is approaching this case, expressing the intention to collaborate closely with local and federal health officials in a comprehensive investigation.</p>
<p>As the situation unfolds, health authorities are working diligently to unravel the mystery behind this rare locally acquired malaria case. While the risk to the general public remains low, heightened vigilance and further research are essential to prevent any potential resurgence of this once nearly eliminated disease.</p>

She believes the compelling evidence might shift perceptions and render Wegovy eligible for insurance coverage, which many have struggled to secure due to its price tag exceeding $1,300 per month's supply.</p>
<p>Dr. Levy emphasized the significance of the 20% reduction, highlighting its potential to combat common misconceptions that have relegated the drug to mere cosmetic appeal. "All of this narrative about people wanting this for aesthetic reasons, I believe, has eclipsed all of the health advantages we may gain from this drug to some extent," she stated.</p>
<p>Considering that heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., Wegovy's dual benefit of heart risk reduction and weight loss could alter the notion that it's solely a vanity-focused medication. Dr. Holly Lofton, director of the weight management program at NYU Langone Health and an investigator in the Novo Nordisk trial, underscored the significance of challenging weight-related stigmas. "It's not well-received because of the weight stigma," Lofton remarked.</p>
<p>The study, conducted in a late-stage clinical trial, enlisted over 17,000 adults aged 45 and above, afflicted by overweight or obesity and existing cardiovascular disease but no history of diabetes. Participants received either a 2.4-milligram dose of <strong>Wegovy</strong> or a placebo alongside standard care. Novo Nordisk reported that the medication exhibited safety and tolerance consistent with previous clinical trials.</p>
<p>While the specifics of participants' weight loss remain undisclosed, the results indicate Wegovy's potential. The company plans to unveil more comprehensive details during its upcoming earnings call.</p>
<p>Despite these promising outcomes, Novo Nordisk's efforts to meet the demand for Wegovy and Ozempic&mdash;a related <strong><a title="Type 2 diabetes medication" href="https://www.executiveheadlines.com/healthcare/diabetes-by-not-consuming-sugar">Type 2 diabetes medication</a></strong> used off-label for weight loss&mdash;have faced challenges. Both drugs share semaglutide as their active ingredient.</p>
<p>According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, about half of all individuals in the United States are obese, a condition associated with various illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, liver issues, and cancer. Clinical trials have increasingly aimed to validate medications' ability to mitigate these weight-related risks.</p>
<p>Dr. Levy noted that this breakthrough is merely the starting point for unveiling the full spectrum of health benefits that such medications can offer. She remarked, "This is only the beginning&hellip;This is just the tip of the iceberg to show the health benefits of these medications."</p>
<p>However, the path to insurance coverage remains uncertain. AHIP, a prominent insurance industry trade group, declined to comment on whether they would extend the range for Wegovy. According to David Allen of AHIP, evaluating a prescription drug's efficacy solely based on a manufacturer's press release is challenging.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels between Wegovy-induced weight loss and the benefits of bariatric surgery, Dr. Levy suggested that the drug could provide comparable advantages. Yet, Dr. Lofton cautioned that Wegovy, along with its class of drugs known as GLP-1 agonists, might not suit everyone due to potential side effects, including abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and pancreatitis.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk aims to petition the Food and Drug Administration to include cardiovascular benefits on Wegovy's prescription label later this year, reinforcing the drug's newfound status as a multifaceted health ally.</p>

The quarter saw a significant 14% and 18% rise in revenues for these respective sectors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, on the flip side, <a title="investment banking revenues" href="../startup-insights/wall-street-six-banks-earn-1-trillion-in-decade">investment banking revenues</a> experienced a decline of 3% due to reduced client activity.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite these positive results, Barclays announced that its U.K. division is expected to generate less interest income, drawing attention from analysts who labeled the bank's overall results "modestly disappointing."</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the second quarter, the bank reported a net income of &pound;1.3 billion ($1.68 billion), in line with market expectations, even with a slightly slower momentum in investment banking.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Analysts had anticipated a net income of &pound;1.4 billion for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data. This figure falls short compared to the &pound;1.78 billion net profit reported in the year's first quarter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Promising Performance from Domestic and Consumer Sectors</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Barclays' strong second-quarter performance was primarily driven by its domestic division and the consumer and cards arm, achieving higher revenues of 14% and 18%, respectively. However, the bank anticipates a lower net interest margin in its domestic bank moving forward. This implies that Barclays is likely to receive less income from the interest it earns on loans and the interest it pays on deposits.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, investment banking revenues fell by 3%, primarily due to reduced client activity.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shares Downturn After Release of Results</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">After announcing the results, Barclays' shares experienced a 5% decline in early trade.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">C. S. Venkatakrishnan, the group chief executive, spoke to CNBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Squawk Box&rdquo; Europe and explained that the anticipated decrease in net interest margins is a consequence of some customers using their savings to repay mortgage loans. This, however, has a positive effect on the bank, as it lowers the risk of payment defaults.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Venkatakrishnan reassured that the U.K. consumer remains cautious but not under financial stress.</span></p>

<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Share Buyback Plan Announced</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the setback in revenue, the Barclays team unveiled a share buyback plan with a budget of up to &pound;750 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to this plan, analysts at Jefferies noted, &ldquo;The &pound;750m buyback is the silver lining in what was a modestly disappointing quarter for revenue.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other Highlights for the Quarter</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apart from the notable performance of the domestic and consumer sectors, there were other significant highlights for Barclays during the second quarter:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Total revenues amounted to &pound;6.3 billion, representing a 6% decrease compared to the &pound;6.7 billion reported in June 2022. The decline was partly attributed to a &pound;758 million impact of over-issuance.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The CET1 ratio, a crucial measure of bank solvency, stood at 13.8%, improving from the previous quarter's 13.6%.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Operating costs decreased by 6% year-on-year.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Barclays Remains Confident for the Future</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite the challenges and modest disappointment in certain areas, Venkatakrishnan expressed the bank's confidence in meeting its targets for the entire year.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He stated, &ldquo;We have positioned Barclays carefully for this <a title="mixed macroeconomic environment" href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/macroeconomics-factors">mixed macroeconomic environment</a> and delivered a consistent performance in the second quarter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">With the strategic focus on its domestic and consumer sectors and the implementation of the share buyback plan, Barclays remains optimistic about its prospects. As the year progresses, the bank aims to build on its current strengths and ensure steady progress in the competitive financial landscape.</span></p>f8:T1575,<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Singapore's United Overseas Bank (UOB) is expecting significant growth in interest income for the next quarter following the <a title="U.S. Federal Reserve's" href="../banking-finance/imf-chief-kristalina-georgieva">U.S. Federal Reserve's</a> recent announcement of a fresh rate hike.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robust Second Quarter Performance</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the second quarter, UOB's core net profit witnessed a remarkable 35% jump, reaching 1.5 billion Singapore dollars ($1.13 billion) compared to last year. The net interest income for the quarter also grew by 31% from the previous year. This growth was driven by a robust net interest margin that expanded by 50 basis points, reaching 2.13% due to higher interest rates. The <a title="bank made this announcement" href="https://uob.listedcompany.com/newsroom/20230727_065417_U11_4ME4H37N2D9FGV1Z.2.pdf">bank made this announcement</a> early on Thursday.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understanding Net Interest Margin</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Net interest margin is a key metric used to measure the lending profitability of banks. It represents the difference between the interest the bank earns on its assets and the interest paid to depositors.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Optimism for the Following Quarter</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UOB's Chief Financial Officer, Lee Wai Fai, hoped the favorable net interest margins would continue in the subsequent quarter. He mentioned potential upside biases following the Federal Reserve's rate hike announcement.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Federal Reserve's Rate Hike Decision</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points, reaching a target range of 5.25%-5.5%. This marks the highest level in over 22 years. The financial markets had already priced in this anticipated move. The midpoint of the target range is the highest benchmark rate since early 2001.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Positive Market Response</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On Thursday, UOB's shares rose by 0.7%, reaching a three-month high. This increase in stock price was in line with the benchmark Straits Times Index in Singapore and was slightly below the 1% gain for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Managing Cost of Funding and Loan Growth Expectations</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lee highlighted that UOB expects loans to be repriced, enabling them to manage their cost of funding more effectively. The bank anticipates a more robust cost management strategy, primarily due to the flight to quality for Singaporean depositors. However, loan-related and wealth management fees declined as investor sentiments remained subdued. An increase in card fees partly offset the decline.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Revised Fee Income Guidance and Credit Cost Projections</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UOB recently adjusted its guidance for fee income, revising it to a high single-digit growth projection. This comes from the <a title="double-digit growth" href="https://www.uobgroup.com/investor-relations/assets/pdfs/investor/financial/2023/ceo-presentation-1q-2023.pdf">double-digit growth</a> projection announced during the first-quarter earnings report. The bank maintains its forecast for low to mid-single-digit loan growth.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bank also adjusted its credit cost projection for the rest of the year. It now expects the credit cost to reach around 25 basis points, slightly higher than the previous projection of 20 to 25 basis points.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Positive Outlook for the Second Half</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite facing challenges in the first half, Lee expressed optimism about the second half of the year. With the reopening of the economy and the revival of trade-related activities, the bank expects to see improved performance. Customers accustomed to the high-interest rate environment will likely return to the market.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Quarterly Earnings Reports</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UOB is the first of Singapore's three central banks to report quarterly earnings. DBS, Singapore's largest lender, will report on August 3, followed by Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp. on August 4.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UOB's second-quarter solid performance and positive outlook for the future demonstrate its resilience and ability to navigate the changing economic landscape. The bank remains cautiously optimistic about the upcoming quarter, driven by the expectation of sustained net interest margins and opportunities in the market.</span></p>

However, the company recently announced that it would refrain from further price hikes in developed markets such as the U.S. and Europe for the rest of the year. This decision follows the lead of its competitor, <a title="PepsiCo" href="https://pepsico.com/">PepsiCo</a>, which had declared a similar stance earlier. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Although both companies experienced robust sales growth due to higher prices, they also witnessed a decline in consumer demand, though less significant than anticipated. In this article, we will delve into the reasons behind Coca-Cola's decision and explore the changing dynamics of the beverage industry.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understanding the Price Hike Strategy</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In response to mounting costs, Coca-Cola initiated a series of price hikes over the past two years. These increases were implemented to mitigate the impact of inflation and maintain the company's profitability. Despite the challenging economic environment, the beverage giant raised its prices by approximately 10% in the second quarter compared to last year's period.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">1. Market Trends in Developed Markets</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The shifting consumer behavior is a significant reason for Coca-Cola's decision to halt further price increases in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe. Customers increasingly opt for private-label bottled water and juices, avoiding traditional carbonated beverages. This preference shift has led to a 1% decline in U.S. unit case volume for Coca-Cola during the second quarter.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">2. Consumer Cost Consciousness</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">During the company's conference call, Coke's CEO, James Quincey, addressed the emerging trend of consumer cost-consciousness. Consumers are now more inclined to seek value in their purchases and are actively looking for items on sale. This behavior is indicative of the evolving mindset of consumers, and it has influenced their purchasing decisions.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">3. PepsiCo's Experience</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">PepsiCo, Coca-Cola's rival, has faced challenges in the beverage market. In February, PepsiCo announced it would avoid additional price hikes beyond regular adjustments in the fourth quarter. The company encountered a more substantial decline in demand compared to Coca-Cola. PepsiCo's North American beverage volume plummeted by 4.5% in the second quarter, with its Quaker Foods North America unit experiencing a 5% decline.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">4. Snacks vs. Beverages</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Interestingly, while Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have faced declining beverage demand, the scenario differs in the snack segment. Frito-Lay North America, a division of PepsiCo, reported a 1% volume growth due to the enduring snack habits of consumers.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">5. Market Response and Investor Outlook</span></strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite <a title="Coca-Cola raising its full-year outlook" href="../food-beverage/coca-cola-beats-estimates-raise-full-year-outlook">Coca-Cola raising its full-year outlook</a> and posting better-than-expected earnings and revenue, its shares experienced a marginal drop of less than 1% in morning trading. The investor response reflects the cautious sentiment in the market and underscores the need for beverage companies to adapt to changing consumer preferences.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The decision by Coca-Cola to halt further price increases in developed markets is a strategic move to address changing consumer dynamics. With increased cost-consciousness and a preference for healthier options, consumers are shifting away from carbonated beverages. As the <a title="beverage industry" href="../industry/food-beverage">beverage industry</a> evolves, companies must innovate and adapt their strategies to remain competitive in a dynamic market.</span></p>fa:Tdc8,<p>On Wednesday, <a title="Coca-Cola" href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/">Coca-Cola</a> pleasantly surprised investors by raising its full-year outlook after reporting earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates. CEO James Quincey attributed the positive results to eased supply chain pressures, diminished concerns surrounding the banking sector, and a pullback in energy prices from record highs.</p>
<p>However, he also cautioned, highlighting that some customers opt for cheaper private-label drinks, and certain commodities like sugar and corn syrup continue to exert pressure on the company's profit margins. Despite these challenges, Coca-Cola's shares closed up more than 1% on the day.</p>
<p>According to the company's report, adjusted earnings per share came in at 78 cents, beating the expected 72 cents. Similarly, revenue reached $11.97 billion, surpassing the expected $11.75 billion. <strong>Coca-Cola's second-quarter net income</strong> attributable to shareholders amounted to $2.55 billion, or 59 cents per share, showing growth compared to the previous year's $1.91 billion, or 44 cents per share.</p>
<p>The company's organic revenue, which excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, witnessed an impressive 11% increase in the quarter, primarily driven by higher prices. Following its rival PepsiCo's footsteps, Coca-Cola provided an optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The company now <a title="expects comparable adjusted earnings per share growth" href="../industry/food-&amp;-beverage/34/Food-safety-testing-market-to-reach-$28.6-billion-by-2026">expects comparable adjusted earnings per share growth</a> of 5% to 6% for 2023, up from the previous forecast of 4% to 5%. Additionally, Coca-Cola hiked its outlook for organic revenue, now predicting an increase of 8% to 9%, compared to the earlier range of 7% to 8%.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola's decision to raise product prices was in response to higher commodity costs, a trend many food and beverage companies have adopted. Although its pricing strategy has not faced significant backlash from customers, there have been signs of shifts in consumer preferences. Some consumers in Europe and the U.S. have switched to private-label bottled water and juices.</p>
<p>CEO James Quincey assured investors that further price hikes are not expected in either region. He explained, "In these markets, pricing is largely in place, and it's expected to moderate as we cycle pricing initiatives from the prior year." Despite facing challenges in the U.S. market, where its volume fell by 1%, Coca-Cola witnessed bright spots in certain divisions.</p>
<p>For instance, Coke Zero Sugar saw a 5% increase in volume, driven by solid demand in North America and Latin America. The Ultra-filtered milk brand Fairlife and the coffee division also reported volume growth of 5%, fueled by reliable performance in the United Kingdom and China.</p>

<p>The decision aims to address administrative issues that have plagued the income-driven repayment system. According to the existing plans, federal student loan borrowers become eligible for forgiveness after making payments for 20 or 25 years, depending on their specific repayment plan.</p>
<p>However, as per the Education Department's news release, some qualifying payments meant to bring borrowers closer to forgiveness were not properly accounted for.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the announcement comes after a recent Supreme Court ruling. Last month, the court struck down President Joe Biden's plan to forgive up to $20,000 in debt for 43 million federal student loan borrowers, dealing a significant blow to one of his key campaign promises.</p>
<p>President Biden remained determined to pursue <strong><a title="student debt loan relief" href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement">student debt loan relief</a></strong> through other avenues despite the setback. He expressed his administration's commitment to finding alternative solutions: "Today's decision has closed one path. "We're going to pursue another now," he said.</p>
<p>To do this, Biden authorized the Education Department to create a new loan forgiveness scheme based on the Higher Education Act. He emphasized that the proposal would be "legally sound" while acknowledging that it might take time before a comprehensive plan could be introduced. However, specific details of the new plan have yet to be unveiled.</p>
<p>The recent announcement represents a smaller step the Biden administration is taking to address federal student loan relief using its existing authority.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona expressed his views on the matter: "For far too long, borrowers fell through the cracks of a broken system that failed to keep accurate track of their progress towards forgiveness. By correcting prior administrative errors, we guarantee that everyone receives the forgiveness they deserve."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not everyone was pleased with the decision. GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri voiced his concerns, accusing the administration of trying to circumvent Congress and implement widespread changes unilaterally.</p>
<p>Schmitt claimed that the administration intended to enact a new debt cancellation plan under Section 432(a) of the Higher Education Act, which he deemed unlawful. He further emphasized that this plan would impose an undue financial burden on hardworking American taxpayers.</p>
<p>In response to criticism from congressional Republicans, President Biden defended the move, highlighting the hypocrisy he perceived. "Republican legislators &mdash; who had no problem with the government erasing millions of dollars of their business loans &mdash; have tried everything they can to prevent me from providing relief to hardworking Americans," Obama said. Biden expressed his dismay at the opposition to the actions that aimed to deliver the promised relief to borrowers who had been making payments for decades yet were denied forgiveness.</p>
<p>The Education Department's decision to automatically forgive student loans for more than 800,000 borrowers represents a significant step toward addressing the student debt crisis.</p>
<p>The $39 billion in federal student loan forgiveness is poised to make a substantial difference in the lives of those burdened with educational loans. While some criticize the move, claiming it bypasses Congress, the Biden administration remains steadfast in helping borrowers struggling with student loan debt.</p>

This legal action accuses the financial institution of disregarding the activities of the now-disgraced late financier, Jeffrey Epstein, about sex trafficking.</p>
<p>In a filing made on Friday in the federal court located in Manhattan, the U.S. Virgin Islands has expressed its desire for JPMorgan to pay a civil fine amounting to $150 million. Additionally, they request that the bank relinquish at least $40 million, representing a portion of the funds obtained during the 15 years of their association with Epstein.</p>
<p>Moreover, the U.S. Virgin Islands demands that JPMorgan compensate Epstein's victims by paying and awarding punitive damages. They also insist on segregating JPMorgan's business and compliance functions and hiring a compliance consultant.</p>
<p>It is crucial to apply monetary penalties and compel behavior adjustments to make sure that JPMorgan Chase understands the cost of putting its own profits ahead of public safety, according to U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Ariel Smith.</p>
<p>JPMorgan has acknowledged the ongoing efforts to settle this case but has declared that the recent filing "does not accurately reflect the nature of the settlement discussions."</p>
<p>The bank has further criticized the U.S. Virgin Islands' arguments for damages, labeling them as "misguided" and lacking substantial foundation.</p>
<p>The Friday filing is noteworthy as it is the first instance where the U.S. Virgin Islands has assigned a specific dollar amount to its lawsuit.</p>
<p>The region deems JPMorgan liable for giving Epstein banking services between 1998 and 2013, which allowed him to reimburse his victims. The lawsuit alleges that the bank disregarded internal warnings and other indicators of wrongdoing due to Epstein's status as a wealthy client.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Virgin Islands, even the mentioned $40 million sum fails to encompass the priceless value of Epstein's alleged introductions of JPMorgan to prominent individuals such as <strong><a title="Britain's Prince Andrew" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Andrew,_Duke_of_York">Britain's Prince Andrew</a></strong> and former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.</p>
<p>Epstein, who died by suicide in August 2019, owned two adjacent islands within the territory. Authorities claim that he acquired one of them to prevent intrusion as he committed sexual abuse against young women and girls on the other island.</p>
<p>The trial for this case is scheduled to commence on October 23.</p>
<h2>Significant Settlements</h2>
<p>This lawsuit represents the largest unresolved case connected to Epstein.</p>
<p>JPMorgan recently agreed to pay $290 million to settle a lawsuit filed by numerous accusers of Epstein. Likewise, Deutsche Bank, another institution where Epstein held accounts, reached a $75 million settlement in May. Both payments are awaiting final court approval.</p>
<p>Epstein's estate has already disbursed over $125 million to his accusers and more than $105 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, was convicted in December 2021 for her involvement in his illicit activities.</p>
<p>In the U.S. Virgin Islands' case, <a title="JPMorgan" href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/"><strong>JPMorgan</strong></a> has attempted to shift blame onto the territory.</p>
<p>The bank has accused the U.S. Virgin Islands of actively assisting Epstein by providing him with tax incentives and waiving the requirements for monitoring sex offenders. Allegedly, these actions were taken in exchange for monetary contributions or gifts to local law enforcement and influential figures, including former first lady Cecile de Jongh.</p>
<p>Separately, JPMorgan is pursuing a lawsuit against Jes Staley, a former private and investment banking executive with a close relationship with Epstein. The bank aims to recoup its losses from the two lawsuits it currently faces.</p>
<p>Staley has expressed regret regarding his friendship with Epstein and has consistently denied any knowledge of the financier's involvement in sex trafficking. He left JPMorgan a few months after Epstein's departure and served as the CEO of Barclays from 2015 to 2021.</p>
<p>U.S. Virgin Islands v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, case number 22-10904, is the name of the proceeding that will be tried in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

<p>The nation's "Big Four" banks have been publicly urging APRA to relax this rule due to the current high-interest rate environment, with the Reserve Bank of Australia's cash rate reaching an 11-year peak of 4.10%.</p>
<p>They argue that individuals who obtained loans before the central bank's policy tightening cannot refinance because they would fail the 3% serviceability test.</p>
<p>In the previous month, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the leading lender, reduced the buffer rate for certain borrowers refinancing their existing home loans from the industry standard of 3% to 1%.</p>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp, the second <a title="biggest mortgage lender in Australia" href="../../../startup-insights/top-5-biggest-mortgage-lenders-in-australia">biggest mortgage lender in Australia</a>, announced in May that it would introduce a modified serviceability assessment rate.</p>
<p>Following NAB's decision, ANZ Group Holdings is the only one of the top four banks that have relaxed its refinancing loan criteria for consumers who do not meet APRA standards.</p>
<p>NAB disclosed that the changes to its refinancing criteria will be effective on July 21. However, the bank also emphasized that it will adopt a "case-by-case" approach when evaluating convenient serviceability.</p>

Citing both internal documents and sources familiar with the matter, the report unveils the intentions of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
<p>The forthcoming allegation by the FTC revolves around Amazon's alleged misuse of its dominance. It is expected that the primary accusation will focus on how Amazon utilizes its power to incentivize online merchants who utilize its logistics services, while simultaneously penalizing those who choose not to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon, being the <strong><a title="e-commerce giant" href="../latest-news/alibaba-reports-slowest-ever-revenue-growth">e-commerce giant</a></strong> under scrutiny, did not provide an immediate response. On the other hand, the FTC declined to comment altogether.</p>
<p>This potential lawsuit would mark the latest action taken by the agency against Amazon in recent times. FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan's office has spent months developing the complaint, finalizing crucial details such as the jurisdiction in which to file the lawsuit, as revealed in the report.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden's administration has been actively pursuing actions to curb the disproportionate market power held by Big Tech companies like Amazon, aiming to foster a more competitive landscape that prioritizes consumer protection.</p>
<p>Just last week, the FTC accused Amazon of enrolling millions of consumers into its paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, without obtaining their consent. Furthermore, the company made it challenging for these individuals to cancel their subscriptions.</p>
<p>In addition to these allegations, the <strong><a title="FTC" href="https://www.ftc.gov/">FTC</a></strong> is currently investigating Amazon's $1.7-billion acquisition of iRobot, the renowned maker of "Roomba" vacuums.</p>
<p>According to the report, the FTC's antitrust case targeting Amazon's online marketplace has been in progress for a substantial period. In June 2019, Amazon received an initial investigation notice from the FTC, as documented in the reports.</p>
<p>These documents contained inquiries about the impact of using Amazon's warehousing and delivery services on product placements for third-party sellers within the online marketplace. Of particular interest were the prominently displayed boxes on the website that granted certain products heightened visibility.</p>
<p>Moreover, the FTC sought records pertaining to any existing arrangements between <strong><a title="Amazon and Apple Inc" href="../security/gmail-new-security-feature-blue-checkmark">Amazon and Apple Inc</a></strong>. The two companies reached an agreement in 2018 that allowed Apple iPhones, iPads, and various other devices to be sold on Amazon's marketplace.</p>ff:T119e,<h2>Key Points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The IMF's Director Kristalina Georgieva told: "We haven't yet seen any significant decline in the number of loans."</li>
<li>The world economy is operating in an "exceptionally uncertain" environment, Georgieva stated: "Pay attention to trends and be flexible, adjusting in the event that trends shift."</li>
<li>The majority of global central banks, which includes those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, have tightened their monetary policies vigorously in order to curb the soaring rate of inflation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has yet to observe enough banks withdrawing from lending to trigger for the U.S. Federal Reserve to shift its rates-hiking cycle.</p>
<p>"We haven't noticed a substantial drop in lending. There are some, but not enough, according to IMF Managing Director <a title="Kristalina Georgieva" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristalina_Georgieva">Kristalina Georgieva</a>, who spoke to CNBC's Karen Tso on Saturday in Dubrovnik, Croatia.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve in a May bank report advised that lending institutions are concerned about the future as problems in the middle-sized financial institutions in the U.S. caused banks to tighten their lending requirements for businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>The Loan officers at the Fed said that they expect the issue to persist for the rest of the year because of lower growth forecasts and worries about deposits flowing out and a lower tolerance to risk.</p>
<p>Georgieva explained,&nbsp;"I cannot stress enough that we live in a very uncertain world. So pay attention to the trends and be flexible in adapting to the changing trends in the event that trend change."</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) made its statement on the speed of the worldwide loan slowdown after its Chief Economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, told&nbsp;next month that banks are situated in a "more risky circumstance" that could jeopardize the IMF's forecast of 2.8% global GDP for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>The majority of the major central banks around the world, including those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, have tightened their monetary policies vigorously to curb the soaring rate of inflation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the global debt of the world has reached a record level that is $305 trillion in the estimation of the Institute of International Finance. The IIF reported in its report of May that the rising levels of debt as well as high interest rates have triggered more concerns over leverage in the global financial system.</p>
<h3>"Slightly More"</h3>
<p>In the meantime, the IMF is still waiting to observe a substantial slowdown in lending, which could prompt the Fed to revert its course, Georgieva said that combined with a robust U.S. jobs report on Friday, it may hike even more.</p>
<p>She "We think they might need to act a bit more, but the pressures from rising wages combined with unemployment continuing at a deficient level suggest the Fed must stay at the current pace," the author continued.</p>
<p>She forecasted that the <strong><a title="U.S. unemployment rate" href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate">U.S. unemployment rate</a></strong> to exceed 4.5%, and possibly 4.5 percent, resulting from further rate hikes from the Fed after the rate climbed to 3.7 percentage in May, which was the highest rate since October 2022.</p>
<p>In the wake of the U.S. government passing the resolution to increase the ceiling on debt which was signed by the president, Joe Biden at the weekend, she stated: "What has been agreed within the context of how it was negotiated in general terms, is an excellent result."</p>
<p>"Our experience has shown that raising the debt ceiling frequently isn't particularly helpful, so that's where the problem resides. There is still time to reevaluate what we can do to address this, she added.</p>

<p>The 14-member panel unanimously recommended the shot, manufactured by Pfizer in the name of its effectiveness. The panel voted 10-4 to endorse it based on its safety.</p>
<p>If the shot gets accepted by the FDA, it will be the first vaccination that protects against respiratory syncytial disease in infants.</p>
<p><em><strong>Also Read, <a title="The Top 3 Health Trends to Watch in 2023" href="../top-news/health-trends-to-watch-in-2023">The Top 3 Health Trends to Watch in 2023</a></strong></em></p>
<p>"Before this pandemic began, RSV was the no. one reason for hospitalizations of infants across the United States, so this is significant," said Dr. Ofer Levy, who is the Director of the Precision Vaccines Program at Boston Children's Hospital. Levy is a non-voting part of the FDA panel but was not involved in the vote on Thursday.</p>
<p>Healthy adults can experience the lower respiratory illnesses that are caused by RSV is usually mild, however, it may be more severe for infants and elderly adults. The virus can kill around 300 kids less than five each annually in the U.S. and up to 10,000 people aged 65 or over according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Severe infections can lead to bronchiolitis or pneumonia causing inflammation of the airways and blocking them with mucus.</p>
<p>It could take a while for the FDA to decide if they want to allow the shot, but the FDA is likely to adhere to the advisory committee's recommendations.</p>
<p>It was announced that the FDA accepted the initial RSV vaccination this month. The vaccine was developed by the pharmaceutical giant <a title="GSK" href="https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/"><strong>GSK</strong></a> however, this shot is for people who are 60 or older.</p>
<p>Pfizer also offers an RSV shot to older adults awaiting FDA approval later this month. An FDA advisory group in February recommended the shot to people who are 60 or older. The same vaccine is given to women who are pregnant.</p>
<p>To safeguard infants, the shot is given to pregnant women from 24 to 36 weeks gestation. the antibodies that protect you are transferred into the placenta.</p>
<p>The members of the committee generally applauded the effectiveness of the vaccine but had reservations regarding the duration of protection as well as the possible possibility of preterm birth.</p>
<p>In a clinical study with more than 7,400 participants, the vaccine reduced the risk of contracting severe disease from RSV for infants by 82% approximately three months after birth. At six months, the effectiveness was about 69 percent. Children six months or younger are particularly susceptible to serious forms of RSV.</p>
<p>The shot also reduced the chance of developing respiratory illness caused by RSV which necessitated doctor's appointments by 51% in approximately six months. Following that the shot didn't seem to make any difference.</p>
<p>In a report that was released, the FDA stated that the safety data from the trial appeared "generally favorable." The most frequently reported side effects from the shot that were reported among pregnant women included headaches, fatigue muscle pain, and injection site discomfort.</p>
<p>However, the agency pointed out the existence of a greater number of preterm births which is defined as births occurring before 37 weeks gestation -- among those who were vaccinated (5.7%) against those who received a placebo (4.7%). The difference was not statistically significant, it's not clear if the reason was due to vaccination.</p>
<p>Both rates were less than what is the prevalence of premature births within the population, which is about 10 percent, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, the pharmaceutical giant GSK stopped its study of the RSV vaccine specifically for babies because it found an increased rate of preterm birth in certain vaccine recipients.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Vaccine Education Centre and a representative on the FDA advisory committee, asserted that the findings of the GSK trial applied to the Pfizer study because the two vaccines have similarities.</p>
<p>Offit said at the hearing on Thursday, "I fear that if premature births are in any way a consequence of this vaccine, it would be unfortunate in many respects. Offit dissented from the vaccine because of its safety.</p>
<p>Pfizer stated that if the <strong><a title="vaccine" href="../retail/niimbl-unveils-3-vaccine-manufacturing-projects-value">vaccine</a></strong> is accepted, the company will continue to examine the risk of premature birth among those who have received the vaccine.</p>
<p>Levy said that researchers typically take note of the risk of premature birth in vaccines administered to women who are pregnant.</p>
<p>"There is always the nagging concern: Are you contributing to any inflammation that could be dangerous? Because the body interprets inflammation as "let's get the baby out, the woman is no longer safe," Therefore, you need a relatively bland vaccine, he said.</p>
<p>However, Adam Berger, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health approved the vaccine based on effectiveness and safety The vaccine is urgently required.</p>
<p>There is no other option for prevention in this situation, and it could save a lot of lives, according to Berger.</p>
<p>Eleven RSV vaccines (including GSK's approved shot) are currently being studied within U.S. trials, according to information that was provided by NBC News by PATH, an international health nonprofit. Six of them are for older people and five are intended to protect infants and children.</p>
<p>A monoclonal antibody injection that is administered directly to infants and works similarly to a vaccine is already recognized by the FDA in Canada, Europe, and the United Kingdom. The FDA started reviewing the data on the shot in January and is scheduled to decide in the season or in the fall if it will allow the shot or not.</p>102:Tb4c,<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The World Health Organization said on Friday that COVID-19 no longer is a worldwide health emergency.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A review of clinical trials has found that consuming higher vitamin D may lead to a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin added to or available in some foods, as a supplement, or produced by the body when the skin gets struck by ultraviolet rays from sunlight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A systematic </span><strong>health</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> review was conducted by the Tufts Medical Center, US and a meta-analysis of three clinical trials comparing vitamin D supplement impacts on diabetes risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers from the US got that for more than a three-year follow-up period, 22.7 per cent of adults who received vitamin D were seen with new-onset diabetes, and 25% of adults who got the placebo, a 15% relative reduction in risk was found.</span></p>

<p>Dispersed healthcare (also known as telemedicine) is a term used to describe the use of technology to provide healthcare services at a distance. This can include providing services to patients in their homes, or to patients in other locations, such as a clinic or hospital. Dispersed healthcare can be used to provide services to patients who live in rural or remote areas, or who have difficulty getting to a <strong><a href="https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/health-sciences/blog/types-of-healthcare-facilities/">healthcare facility</a></strong>. It can also be used to provide services to patients who are unable to leave their homes, such as those who are bedridden or have a disability.</p>
<p><strong>The benefits of dispersed healthcare.</strong></p>
<p>There are many benefits to dispersed healthcare. One of the most important is that it can help to prevent the spread of disease. By having patients treated in different facilities, it is much more difficult for a virus or other pathogen to spread. This is because the likelihood of exposure is reduced, and if one facility does become infected, it is less likely to cause a widespread outbreak.</p>
<p>Dispersed healthcare can also be more cost-effective. This is because it allows for the sharing of resources, and patients can be treated closer to home. This can also improve the quality of care, as patients can receive more personalized treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, dispersed healthcare can help to improve the security of the healthcare system. By having multiple facilities, it is much more difficult for an attacker to cause widespread damage. This can help to prevent the loss of life and protect the privacy of patients.</p>
<p><strong>How dispersed healthcare works.</strong></p>
<p>There are many different ways to deliver healthcare, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. One of the most popular methods is dispersed healthcare, which is when patients receive care from a variety of different providers. This type of care is often seen as more convenient for patients, as they can choose the provider that is the best fit for them. Additionally, dispersed healthcare can be more cost-effective, as patients are not reliant on a single provider. However, this type of care can also be more challenging to manage, as patients may not always receive the same level of care from different providers.</p>
<p><strong>The future of dispersed healthcare.</strong></p>
<p>The future of dispersed healthcare is looking very bright. With the increasing popularity of <a href="https://www.telehealth.com/"><strong>telehealth</strong></a> and telemedicine, more and more people are able to get the medical care they need without having to leave their homes. This is especially beneficial for patients who are unable to travel or who have difficulty accessing traditional healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Telehealth and telemedicine have also been shown to be cost-effective, which is another reason why they are becoming increasingly popular. In fact, a recent study found that the use of telehealth and telemedicine can save healthcare providers up to 30% on costs.</p>
<p>All of these factors are contributing to the rise of dispersed healthcare, and it is likely that this trend will continue in the years to come.</p>115:Tb87,<p>Even in the face of uncertain futures, ambitious strategic goals like increasing revenues and advancing digital business necessitate action. The Top Investment Trends from Executive headlines for 2023 might help you create an action plan since technology is essential to success.

<p>One of Brightman's unexpected tactics? Don't place excessive bond wagers. According to Tully, "RA's pessimistic opinion on most bonds contradicts what the fixed income markets are saying." According to Brightman, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, offer the best deals.</p>
<p>He said to Tully: "Government bonds aren't a good place to be given the continuance of inflation, which will probably be higher than the markets anticipate. Corporates, however, are far more alluring than they were the previous year.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">According to a recent Financial Times survey of analysts, the United Kingdom is experiencing a "deeper and more extended recession" than any other G7 country. Given that they are preparing for a recession, CFOs in the UK find debt financing to be quite unappealing. Additionally, the EU's GDP increased by just 0.6% annually in the first three quarters of 2022. </span> Europe is ranked by Brightman as the most potential market in the world, which is surprising. He told Tully, "Companies are not countries. "The United States may have had faster GDP growth than countries like the Netherlands and Switzerland, but that doesn't mean that Unilever, Royal Dutch Shell, or Nestl&eacute; are growing their profits more slowly than similarly sized American businesses.</p>

<p><strong>Consumer staples:</strong></p>
<p>Consumer staples are defined as products and services that, despite economic fluctuations, customers consistently buy because they are regarded as necessary.

Here are a few key health stories making headlines on this 5th day of January:</p>
<p>New recommendations for cancer screening tests: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has released updated guidelines for several cancer screening tests. The recommendations include starting mammograms at age 50 (previously age 40) and only getting a colonoscopy every 10 years (previously every 5-10 years). The task force cited a lack of evidence that earlier or more frequent testing leads to better health outcomes. These recommendations are controversial and some medical organizations, such as the American Cancer Society, disagree with them.</p>
<p>New laws for e-cigarettes and flavored tobacco products: As of January 1st, it is now illegal to sell flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes, in the state of California. This law is aimed at reducing the appeal of these products to youth. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarette pods, with the exception of tobacco, mint, and menthol flavors. This ban is also aimed at reducing the use of these products among youth, who have been using e-cigarettes at an increasing rate in recent years.</p>
<p>Flu season continues to be a concern: The flu season is well underway and health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccine if they haven't already. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that flu activity is high in many parts of the country, with the majority of cases being caused by the H1N1 strain. The flu can be serious, especially for people with underlying health conditions and the elderly, so it's important to take precautions such as washing your hands frequently and staying home if you are sick.</p>

The study says that it is the attack on the olfactory nerve cells which is causing the mess. The ongoing immunity assault on those nerves decline in the number of those cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The study was published by a team of scientists led by Duke Health report on Dec. 21 in the journal Science Translational Medicine which provides an important insight into a vexing problem that has plagued millions who have not fully recovered their sense of smell after COVID-19.</p>
<p>"One of the first symptoms that has typically been associated with COVID-19 infection is loss of smell," said senior author Bradley Goldstein, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in Duke's Department of Head and Neck Surgery and Communication Sciences and the Department of Neurobiology.</p>
<p>"Fortunately, many people who have an altered sense of smell during the acute phase of viral infection will recover smell within the next one to two weeks, but some do not," Goldstein said. "We need to better understand why this subset of people will go on to have persistent smell loss for months to years after being infected with SARS-CoV2."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The study</h2>
<p>According to News Medical and Life Sciences, "In the study, Goldstein and colleagues at Duke, Harvard and the University of California-San Diego analyzed olfactory epithelial samples collected from 24 biopsies, including nine patients suffering from long-term smell loss following COVID-19.</p>
<p>This biopsy-based approach -- using sophisticated single-cell analyses in collaboration with Sandeep Datta, M.D., Ph.D., at Harvard University -- revealed widespread infiltration of T-cells engaged in an inflammatory response in the olfactory epithelium, the tissue in the nose where smell nerve cells are located. This unique inflammation process persisted despite the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 levels."</p>
<p>For more updates on healthcare industry,&nbsp;<a href="../industry/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a></p>118:T959,<p>According to Neuro Science News.Com, "Antidepressant use during pregnancy may combine with inflammation to heighten the risk of lifelong neurodevelopmental changes in babies&rsquo; brains, such as those linked to autism, new research from the University of Virginia School of Medicine suggests.</p>
<p>A team of UVA neuroscientists found that commonly used antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can interact powerfully with inflammation in the mother&rsquo;s body from infections or other sources. In lab mice, this interaction caused harmful changes in the placenta and the decidua&mdash;the direct connection between mother and child&mdash;and affected the developing brain"</p>
<h2>Experts's opinions</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Our findings suggest that [SSRIs] can have deleterious consequences when mixed with infection, inflammation, etc.,&rdquo; said senior researcher John Lukens, Ph.D., of the UVA Department of Neuroscience and its Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG), as well as the UVA Brain Institute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results might help to explain the rise in autism prevalence over the last 20 years, as this time coincides with the rollout of widespread SSRI usage in the developing world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We identified inflammatory signatures in the placenta that correlated with neurologic changes in the adult offspring of mothers that encountered an immune challenge during pregnancy,&rdquo; said researcher Kristine Zengeler, the first author of a new scientific paper outlining the findings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These signatures could be used to help identify biomarkers and druggable targets to help mitigate neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal environmental stressors, like an immune response.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found that mothers who encountered an immune challenge during pregnancy showed a totally different signature in the placenta when they were on SSRIs compared to mothers that were not on SSRIs,&rdquo; Zengeler said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This highlights the importance of considering the entire prenatal environment, as drugs designed to dampen inflammation may lead to unanticipated consequences on the baby if they are combined with other modulators, such as SSRIs.&rdquo;</p>

Tripledemic is an epidemic of three separate diseases occurring at the same time. First of all Covid cases are again being seen in different countries. SARS-CoV-2 virus is being accompanied by some other outbreaks. In the USA , Europe and Asia the flu virus and a third dangerous pathogen&mdash;the respiratory syncytial virus are spreading like wildfire.</p>
<h2>Your chance of getting infected</h2>
<p>According to NBC News, "If you&rsquo;ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive for Covid, symptoms from any of the omicron subvariants generally appear two to four days later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How contagious you are is connected to how much of the virus, known as the viral load, is in your body. Your viral load will likely peak soon after the start of symptoms, according to Dr. Chanu Rhee, an infectious disease physician and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. This means you are likely most contagious a day or so before symptoms appear and during at least the first two or three days after.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your immune system reduces your viral load, your infectiousness should decline in tandem."</p>
<h2>Other viruses</h2>
<p>According to The Daily Beast, "Add another monkeypox or bird flu outbreak, and we might even experience a &ldquo;quadrupledemic.&rdquo; Besides potentially overwhelming health systems, the simultaneous outbreaks come with another troubling risk. Research indicates they might actually make each other worse."</p>
<h2>Figures</h2>
<p>According to The Guardian, "A &ldquo;tripledemic&rdquo; of Covid, RSV and flu is bad news for adult hospital wards: even in a normal year, an estimated 60,000 to 120,000 older adults are hospitalised and 6,000 to 10,000 of them die from RSV in the US alone."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Perseverance rover</h2>
<p>According to Wikipedia, "Perseverance, nicknamed Percy,[2] is a car-sized Mars rover designed to explore the Jezero crater on Mars as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission. It was manufactured by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and launched on July 30, 2020, at 11:50 UTC.[3] Confirmation that the rover successfully landed on Mars was received on February 18, 2021, at 20:55 UTC.[4][5] As of 19 December 2022, Perseverance has been active on Mars for 650 sols (669 Earth days, or 1 year, 10 months and 1 day) since its landing. Following the rover's arrival, NASA named the landing site Octavia E. Butler Landing."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The process of sample collection</h2>
<p>On September 7, the rover drilled a hole on the left side of the rock. The hole is named Montagnac. On September 1 another hole on the right side of the rock. It is named Montdenier. It collected the samples from those holes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The process being continued</h2>
<p>According to&nbsp; CNN, "Perseverance isn't letting any dust gather under its wheels. The rover is about to build the first depot on another world as it drops a collection of rock and dust samples on the Martian surface.</p>
<p>These samples are part of a matching set that will remain stowed on the rover &mdash; and either cache could be the collection that makes its way back to Earth in 2033 through the Mars Sample Return program.</p>
<p>The rover is also plotting a course up the steep bank of an ancient river delta and will begin studying the intriguing material there in February.</p>
<p>While Perseverance was investigating Jezero Crater on Mars in 2021, a towering whirlwind of dust passed right over it. The rover's microphone happened to be turned on at the time, and the robotic explorer captured the eerie sounds in an audio recording released this week."</p>

<p>Regarding the prevention of three same they said, "RSV, strep A, the flu and other illnesses and infections are resurging among children, after having been mostly suppressed during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Here's what doctors and health authorities say parents can do to keep children safe and healthy in the winter.</p>
<p>The NHS and other health authorities recommend washing your hands with soap for 20 seconds to help stop the spread of viruses and bacteria, including strep A and RSV. They also recommend being careful not to share potentially contaminated cups, towels or other items.</p>
<p>Parents are advised to use tissues to help their children catch coughs or sneezes, then discard the used tissues as soon as possible and wash their hands with soap and warm water to stop the spread.</p>

<p>For more updates on healthcare industry,&nbsp;<a href="../industry/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a></p>11d:T8fe,<p>Dyson made an announcement regarding it's new Zone noise-canceling and air-purifying headphones. Earlier this year Dyson didn&rsquo;t announce pricing or availability, nor did it say much about battery life. But on Wednesday, it shared that information. Let&rsquo;s begin with the detail everyone wants to know. When the wearable arrives in the US next March, it will start at an eye-watering $949, making it almost twice as expensive as the AirPods Max.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>According to Engadget, "Both the standard and Dyson Direct models come with the Zone&rsquo;s signature vizor, as well as a dedicated sleeve and cleaning brush. According to Dyson, the electrostatic filters are rated to provide up to 12 months of use before they should be replaced. The filters feature a dual-layer design that incorporates potassium-enriched carbon to capture acidic gasses like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone. All told, the company claims the filters will block 99 percent of particles, including ones that are as small as 0.1 microns.</p>
<p>On the audio front, the Zone headphones are capable of up to 38 decibels of noise cancellation and feature 40-millimeter neodymium drivers. You can use the MyDyson companion app to choose between three audio equalization modes dubbed Dyson EQ, Bass Boost and Neutral. At launch, the headphones will support SBC, AAC and LHDC audio codecs, as well as Bluetooth 5.0.</p>
<p>Battery life will depend on how extensively you use the Zone&rsquo;s air filtration feature. If it&rsquo;s not powering the Visor, the Zone&rsquo;s 2,600mAh battery can provide up to 50 hours of listening time on a single charge. Using the visor at its slowest setting reduces battery life to a modest four hours. Increasing purification speed to the &ldquo;Mid&rdquo; and &ldquo;High&rdquo; flow settings further reduces battery life to two-and-a-half hours and one-and-a-half hours, respectively.

<p>The scientists said that Overall, 58% of the calories consumed in the U.S., 57% of British, 48% of Canadian and 30% of Brazilian diets come from ultra-processed foods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Foods included in this category</h2>
<p>These type of foods include sweet and savory snacks, confectionery, breakfast cereals, ice cream, sugar-sweetened beverages, processed meats and ready-to-eat frozen meals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The findings of the study</h2>
<p>According to UPI health news, "Study participants at the upper end of ultra-processed food consumption -- for whom the daily energy percentage contribution of such foods was above 19.9% -- showed a 28% faster rate of global cognitive decline, and a 25% faster rate of decline in executive function -- the mental skills used every day to learn, work and manage daily life.</p>
<p>That's compared with people who ate no ultra-processed foods or, if they did, stayed below the 19.9% threshold over a follow-up period that averaged eight years."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Study</h2>
<p>They also talked about the study. According to them, "Food and drink consumption over 12 months was assessed at baseline using a standardized food frequency questionnaire. The frequency of consumption of each item was transformed into grams per day, and then foods were classified, according to the extent of industrial processing used in making them, into one of three food groups."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Place of the study</h2>
<p>About the place and participants of the study they said, "a team of researchers led by Natalia Gomes Gon&ccedil;alves, of the Department of Pathology at the University of S&atilde;o Paulo Medical School in S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil, set about to investigate the association between ultra-processed food consumption and cognitive decline among 10, 775 participants in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health.</p>
<p>The study involved an ethnically diverse sample of public servants, ages 35 to 74, who were recruited in six Brazilian cities."</p>
<p>For more updates on healthcare industry,&nbsp;<a href="../industry/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a></p>11f:Tbb2,<p>On 1 Feb 2022, Google&rsquo;s parent company Alphabet announced that its board has approved plans for a 20-for-1 stock split as a part of the company&rsquo;s quarterly earnings statement. Following the news, Alphabet&rsquo;s stock rose more than 9% in after-marketing trading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Expansive Market Capitalization</h2>
<p>The announcement comes 1.5 years after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL">Apple split its stock</a>, giving three shares for each share that are owned by people. Alphabet and Apple are among the few technology companies that have witnessed their market capitalizations stretch into the trillions, as investors opted for profitable growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 20-for-1 split outdoes the recent stock splits from Apple as well as Tesla. Both the companies opted for a 4-for-1 and 5-for-1 split respectively on the same day in August 2020. Whereas, the graphics chip maker Nvidia, another tech stock popular with retail investors, split 4-for-1 in July 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Splitting of the Shares</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q4_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=d72fc76">reports</a>, Alphabet intends to split the Class A, Class B and Class C shares of the stock, while the change requires the approval of shareholders. Each shareholder at the close of business on July 1 will receive 19 additional shares for each share of the same class of stock they own toward July 15.</p>
<p>Previously in 2012, Google added a third class of shares, Class C, with no voting rights. The company already had Class A shares that carry one vote per share, and Class B shares that are held closely by founders and early investors with 10 votes. Alphabet maintained the stock structure through its 2015 rebrand to Alphabet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Effective Stock Split</h2>
<p>Stock splits lower the price of a stock to possibly make it more attractive to retail investors. What makes Google&rsquo;s stock split interesting is just how long it took for the company to move forward with actually splitting its share. In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312504073639/ds1.htm">letter that included the 2004 prospectus for Google&rsquo;s initial public offering</a>, Google&rsquo;s founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin emphasized that they would always act with the long-term welfare of the company and shareholders in mind.</p>
<p>In addition, the founders also described the introduction of the third class as &ldquo;effectively a stock split&rdquo; in a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001288776/000119312512160666/d333341dex993.htm">2012 letter</a> and said it was something many shareholders had been clamoring for. Moreover, the 2-for-1 stock split came in 2014&mdash;before the switch to Alphabet.</p>

This suggests that the converted lungs could be transplanted into any recipient, irrespective of their blood type, as long as the organs were the appropriate size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Universal Lungs in EVLP</h2>
<p>The study was published on 16 Feb 2022 in the journal &lsquo;<a href="https://www.science.org/journal/stm"><em>Science Translational Medicine</em></a>&rsquo;. In the new study, a team of researchers ran experiments on the universal lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) device that keeps lungs alive outside the body. According to Dr. <strong>Marcelo Cypel</strong>, the surgical director of the Ajmera Transplant Centre, a professor of surgery at the University of Toronto and senior author of the study, the study authors plan to test such organs in a clinical trial with human recipients in the upcoming years.</p>
<p>According to <strong>Dr. Richard N. Pierson III</strong>, a professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and the scientific director of the Center for Transplantation Science at Massachusetts General Hospital, the technology of universal lungs could help reduce the number of donated lungs that must be discarded because there's no size-matched and blood-type compatible recipient nearby. He further added that organ size and blood type are the primary factors used to match organ donors and recipients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Addressing Shortage of O Lungs</h2>
<p>Additionally, Dr. Richardson added that the universal lungs technology would help address the current shortage of O lungs, for O patients the waiting time is the longest and the shortage most severe.&nbsp; Patients with blood type O have a 20% greater risk of dying while waiting for a lung transplant than those with other blood types; they have to wait longer because they cannot accept organs from donors of any other blood type, according to a 2019 report in The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation.</p>
<p>In a statement, Cypel added, &ldquo;<em>If we could take this barrier out of the allocation system, I think this will &hellip; decrease the wait time for patients and also mortality on the waitlist</em>.&rdquo; Currently, Cypel and his colleagues have begun preparing a proposal for a clinical trial of the enzyme-treated lungs. In human patients, the team will be able to address questions that cannot be answered by their lab study.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>121:T7e9,<p>Google Assistant will not be as useful as it is expected to be this month as Google is sunsetting its Duplex on the Web service which allows customers to book tickets or make reservations through a streamlined Assistant-led interface that automatically integrates personal information from the user's Google account. Google on Search Console Help Web page said, "Duplex on the Web is deprecated, and will no longer be supported as of December, 2022. Any automation features enabled by Duplex on the Web will no longer be supported after this date.</p>
<p>Duplex on the Web is a technology that enables Google Assistant to automate certain user tasks for your site visitors."</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we continue to improve the Duplex experience, we&rsquo;re responding to the feedback we&rsquo;ve heard from users and developers about how to make it even better,&rdquo; a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch via email, adding that Duplex on the Web partners have been notified to help them prepare for the shutdown. &ldquo;By the end of this year, we&rsquo;ll turn down Duplex on the Web and fully focus on making AI advancements to the Duplex voice technology that helps people most every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is Duplex</h2>
<p>According to Tech Church, "Google introduced Duplex on the Web, an outgrowth of its call-automating Duplex technology, during its 2019 Google I/O developer conference. To start, it was focused on a couple of narrow use cases, including opening a movie theater chain&rsquo;s website to fill out all of the necessary information on a user&rsquo;s behalf &mdash; pausing to prompt for choices like seats. But Duplex on the Web later expanded to passwords, helping users automatically change passwords exposed in a data breach, as well as assist with checkout for e-commerce retailers, flight check-in for airline sites and automatic discount finding."</p>

According to The Times of India, "Both names &mdash; mpox and monkeypox &mdash; will be used simultaneously for one year while the latter is phased out, the WHO said in a statement on Monday. The change comes after several individuals and countries raised concerns in several meetings and asked the WHO to propose a way to change the name.</p>
<p>The one-year transition period mitigates experts' concerns about the confusion caused by a name change in the middle of a global outbreak. It also gives time to complete the International Classification of Diseases update process and to update WHO publications, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
<p>In July, the WHO officially declared the multi-country monkeypox outbreak outside of the traditional endemic areas in Africa a public health emergency of international concern, the highest level of alert that the global health authority can issue."</p>
<p>They also said, "The WHO is responsible for assigning names to new and existing diseases through a consultative process, including the WHO member states. The consultation on monkeypox has involved representatives from government authorities of 45 countries, it said.</p>
<p>According to the WHO, as of Saturday, 110 member states had reported 81,107 laboratory-confirmed cases and 1,526 probable cases, including 55 deaths. Most cases reported in the past four weeks were from the Americas (92.3%) and Europe (5.8%). The weekly reported new cases globally decreased by 46.1% from November 21 to November 27."</p>
<p>The name of the disease was changed to avoid the racism. This move by WHO proves that the organization takes care of the emotions of the individuals while taking care of the health of the masses.</p>
<p>For more updates on healthcare industry,&nbsp;<a href="../industry/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a></p>125:T8f8,<p>In the case of diabetes so many questions arise. One of those questions is: Is it possible to get diabetes by not consuming sugar?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hindustantimes</a> has talked about this issue in one of their articles.</p>
<p>According to them, "In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr A Sharda, Consultant - Endocrinologist and Diabetologist at Manipal Hospital on Millers Road shared, &ldquo;Type 2 Diabetes is more closely linked to genetic predisposition than to dietary habits like the consumption of sugar. So, if a person has a genetic predisposition (a family history) of diabetes and consumes excess sugar in their daily food intake, resulting in obesity, they have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes at an earlier stage than others. However, we can delay the onset of type 2 diabetes by many years even if we have a family history by adopting a few lifestyle measures that include regular exercise, a healthy diet and weight maintenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Dr Sandeep Reddy, Senior Endocrinologist at Kamineni Hospitals in Hyderabad, many people believe that it is possible to get diabetes by not consuming sugar but this is not true. He explained, &ldquo;People with diabetes also have a higher risk of developing other autoimmune conditions, such as Crohn's disease or lupus. Consuming sugar indirectly through the foods that you eat can also increase your risk of developing diabetes. For example, eating processed foods that are loaded with sugar can increase your risk of developing diabetes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They also said, "Highlighting that prediabetes is a condition in which you have higher blood sugar levels but no symptoms of diabetes, he cautioned, &ldquo;If you have prediabetes, you're at an increased risk of developing diabetes later on. Time is the key factor in whether or not you'll develop diabetes. If you have prediabetes, your blood sugar levels may stay high for a long time without causing any symptoms. This means that it may take a long time for your blood sugar levels to reach the level that's considered to be a sign of diabetes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The lawsuit</h2>
<p>According to Politico, "The Federal Trade Commission is likely to file an antitrust lawsuit to block Microsoft&rsquo;s $69 billion takeover of video game giant Activision Blizzard, maker of the hit games Call of Duty and Candy Crush, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>A lawsuit would be the FTC&rsquo;s biggest move yet under Chair Lina Khan to rein in the power of the world&rsquo;s largest technology companies. It would also be a major black mark for Microsoft, which has positioned itself as a white knight of sorts on antitrust issues in the tech sector after going through its own grueling regulatory antitrust battles around the world more than two decades ago."</p>
<p>They also said, "A lawsuit challenging the deal is not guaranteed, and the FTC&rsquo;s four commissioners have yet to vote out a complaint or meet with lawyers for the companies, two of the people said. However, the FTC staff reviewing the deal are skeptical of the companies&rsquo; arguments, those people said.</p>
<p>The investigation remains ongoing, but much of the heavy lifting is completed, including depositions of Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and Activision head Bobby Kotick, the people with knowledge of the investigation said. If the agency does move ahead with a case, it could come as soon as next month, said the people, all of whom were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter."</p>
<p>Polygon said, "Meanwhile, the war of words between Sony and Microsoft over the deal took an absurd turn Wednesday when the U.K. regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority, released clashing statements the two companies had made to its investigators in October. Sony is pleading with regulators to block the deal, saying Microsoft controlling Activision Blizzard, and particularly the Call of Duty franchise, will kill off competition in the games market."</p>

Even though countries all over the world have committed to keeping the average global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events are getting worse, and the Arctic is not looking good.</p>
<p>It is critical for all people to understand climate change and its very real effects. Although accepting the truth can be difficult and there is legitimate cause for concern regarding climate change, keeping the public informed is essential for both our survival and the survival of the planet. Perhaps you don't have the time or desire to read the studies yourself, as Mashable science editor Mark Kaufman does for you in his Climate 101 series. No issue. You can watch an informative documentary to learn more about what's happening to the one and only Earth we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here are the best climate change documentaries and where to watch them.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>2040</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would the world be like in 20 years if we actually put the technological solutions we currently have in place to combat climate change? In order to create a visual letter for his daughter Velvet, who is 4 years old, Australian filmmaker Damon Gameau wanted to learn in 2019. Gameau travelled the world to speak with people working on renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, marine permaculture, and electric, shared transportation systems who are creating ways to reduce emissions, sequester excess carbon from the system, and disrupt the current economic system.</p>

<h3>Our Planet</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Chapman's film Our Planet, which explores the interconnectedness of everything from food chains to weather patterns and how climate change is affecting everything, is reminiscent of classic Attenborough. Attenborough narrates, "Crucial connections are being disrupted all over our planet." "The stability on which we and all life depends is eroding. The course of all life on Earth will be determined by what we do over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>An Inconvenient Truth + An Inconvenient Sequel</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Inconvenient Truth gives an idea of how long we've been having this conversation, the insignificant steps policymakers have taken or haven't taken, and the anger over our leaders' lack of concern. The film explains the fundamental science behind global warming, demonstrates the link between rising CO2 levels and the earth's temperature, and drives home the point that current levels of CO2 and those predicted by scientists are far above what the planet naturally produces. Additionally, the movie draws a connection between warming ocean temperatures and extreme weather events like Hurricane Katrina, which unfortunately receives a brutal update in the sequel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h3>Fire in Paradise</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interviews with unfathomably brave Cal Fire and volunteer firefighters, 911 fire dispatchers, and residents who were trapped by walls of flame on all sides are used in the 40-minute documentary to recreate this catastrophe. Fire in Paradise uses this information, along with news reports and terrifying phone footage, to show how quickly these fires spread, engulfing homes, businesses, and roads. Additionally, it places them in the context of California's increasingly frequent and severe wildfires brought on by climate change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h3>Lowland Kids</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isle de Jean Charles, a sinking island off the coast of Louisiana, will eventually vanish entirely as a result of sea level rise. The 20-minute short film Lowland Kids, which had its world premiere at SXSW in 2019, introduces you to Howard and Juliette, two teenage siblings who were born and raised on the island and will soon become the country's first climate refugees. The film, which explores the idea of home and displacement as a result of climate change, presents an intimate portrait of a family on the verge of involuntary upheaval with the help of moving direction from Sandra Winther, stunning cinematography, and frank, incredibly sad interviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h3>Chasing Coral</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest threat to coral reefs is caused by human-induced climate change, even more so than pollution and unsustainable fishing. Reefs in the Florida Keys, American Samoa, the Bahamas, Bermuda, Hawaii, New Caledonia, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef have all been severely damaged by global warming, rising sea temperatures, and ocean acidification. The movie not only demonstrates how intrinsically linked these ecosystems are to our own, but also how devastating it is for the team that dives every day to manually monitor the reef's ecological collapse. There are many historical comparisons used to show how the reefs are dying throughout the movie, but nothing can prepare you for the time lapse that is revealed at the very end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h3>The Condor and the Eagle</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directed by Sophie and Cl&eacute;ment Guerra, The Condor and the Eagle examines a key contributor to climate change &mdash; the fossil fuel industry &mdash; and its disproportionate impact on Indigenous communities. In interviews with Indigenous leaders, activists, and organisers, the film makes plain the serious impact the coal and oil industry is having on First Nations communities, while heralding the need for inclusive solutions to the global crisis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h3>I Am Greta</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The movie I Am Greta is quieter than you might expect. The documentary, which will be released in 2020 and was directed by Nathan Grossman, follows the 15-year-old activist and her father, Svante, from her "Skolstrejk f&ouml;r klimatet" protests to her 2018 speech at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland and her meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in 2019. Most importantly, the movie follows Thunberg aboard the Malizia II, the sailboat she used to travel from Britain to New York City and shame apathetic adults at the 2019 U.N. Climate Action Summit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h3>The Great Green Wall</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This breathtaking documentary centres on Africa's ambitious Great Green Wall, an 8,000-kilometer wall of trees planted by local communities all over the continent to rebuild land that has been devastated by the effects of climate change. This one was executive produced by Fernando Meirelles, the director of City of God, and was hosted by activist and singer Inna Modja from Mali. The U.N. reported that temperatures are rising in the Sahel region, which includes Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and The Gambia, 1.5 times faster than the global average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h3>Kiss the Ground</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 2020 documentary, which examines a climate change solution that is "right under our feet, and it's as old as dirt," is narrated by Woody Harrelson. Soil is the only thing that "could just be the one thing that can balance our climate, replenish our fresh water supplies, and feed the world" because of its size and capacity to store enormous amounts of greenhouse gases. With a brief cameo from Tom Brady and Gisele B&uuml;ndchen, why not?, the documentary initially appeals to our more self-motivated tendencies by praising the health advantages of eating nutrient-rich food grown in healthy soil. However, for the most part, it emphasises soil's crucial capacity to absorb carbon from the atmosphere.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>12a:T20fa,<p>It is imperative that technology and financial services are integrated. Financial service providers that can't adapt to technological advancements will eventually fail.

When it comes to writing, the best content is often the one that isn&rsquo;t even written. Instead of spending time crafting a new piece from scratch, think of what would happen if you just looked at the first few sentences and allowed a computer to fill in the blanks? Artificial intelligence can do this as well as anyone else. It can read articles faster than any human and decipher their meaning with accuracy that no one else can match. A combination of these two things could make AI-assisted copywriting an effective strategy for improving your content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What Is Artificial Intelligence in Copywriting?</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is an umbrella term for technologies that allow computer systems to perform tasks that once required human intelligence. These tasks could be anything from data analysis to writing. Artificial intelligence could also be used in content marketing, although it&rsquo;s typically used to improve analytical processes. AI has been a hot topic in marketing for quite some time, but it&rsquo;s only recently become a real boon for marketers. With advancements in the field of computer vision, machine learning, and natural language processing, AI is now able to analyze and interpret data like never before. This makes it possible to get insights and information about your audience with incredible accuracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How AI Helps Write Better Articles</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is a boon for copywriters because it&rsquo;s a great way to test new ideas. In order to come up with fresh ideas, you have to write a lot of articles that aren&rsquo;t new, so it&rsquo;s important to try out new ideas and see if they work. AI can help with the writing process by analyzing an article and generating new ideas. It would comb through the text, get the main idea, and suggest new concepts and ideas. AI can also help with formatting and flow, and it can be especially helpful if you&rsquo;re writing for a technical audience that is really picky about things like formatting, sentence structure, and word usage. AI can be used to check for errors in a piece, as well as flag formatting issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Be Clear and Concise</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You want to make sure that your articles are clear and concise because a reader needs to be able to understand the content in order to take action. AI can help with this because it can detect which words are less meaningful and which ones are more important. AI can also detect unclear sentences and suggest replacing unclear words with clearer versions. AI can also detect how long a piece is and how much information it should include. It can then suggest shortening the article or removing parts that aren&rsquo;t important. Writing is an art, and AI can help to improve your article&rsquo;s clarity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h3>Use Sentiment Analysis to Find Your Audience&rsquo;s Weak Spots</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sentiment analysis can help to understand your audience&rsquo;s mood and find their weak spots. AI can detect which words are used most in negative or positive sentences, and then it can help you to write content that addresses these feelings. AI can also detect what topics get the most reactions and reactions of anger, sadness, or other emotions. You can use this to find topics that draw the most emotion, and you can use AI to help you to write content that addresses these feelings. AI can also help you to understand your audience by detecting which personality types you have in your audience and which ones you don&rsquo;t have. You can use this to write articles that address a wider range of topics and feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h3>Get Data-Driven Content Strategies From a Writing Platform like Wordsmith.io</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI can help you with formatting, flow, and clarity, but what good is it if you don&rsquo;t make use of the insights it provides? AI can help you to get more out of your writing by digging into what it found in your content. It can be helpful to open a writing platform like Wordsmith.io and see what it uncovered for you. You can also use a content analysis tool to see what AI found in your content, and then you can make changes to the article based on what it found. You can also make use of a content analysis tool that integrates with your content marketing platform like Hubspot, so you can access the insights AI has found in your content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Artificial intelligence can help you improve your writing, and it can also provide you with more insights into what your readers are feeling and how they feel about certain topics. AI can also help you to make sure that your articles are clear and concise. It can also help you to be more concise by digging into how long your sentences are and how much information they should include per article. AI can also help you to make sure that your writing is clear and concise by detecting which words are used less frequently and which ones are used more frequently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>12d:T1691,<p>What is the digital economy? The digital economy is an economic system where more than half of the GDP comes from information, knowledge, and communication technologies.

</ul>131:Ta1b,<p>Meta&rsquo;s hiring intake is pacing down. In the current year, <strong><a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-limit-hiring-slow-revenue-growth-061444313.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta is limiting its hiring procedure</a></strong> and intake to cut costs due to weak revenue forecasts. Meta is slowing the pace or pausing hiring for most mid-to-senior level positions altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Decelerated Hiring Intake</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meta is limiting its hiring intake of new employees. The limited hiring intake is a part of its efforts to cut costs due to weak revenue forecasts. It has started putting recruitment on hold, the sources said, after holding off on hiring new entry-level engineers over the past weeks.</p>
<p>Facebook's latest quarterly earnings results were better than expected, and its daily active users even bounced back a bit from last quarter. However, the company also expects a revenue drop next quarter in part because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>Company CFO David Wehner said during the earnings call that Meta &ldquo;experienced a further deceleration in growth following the start of the Ukraine war due to the loss of revenue in Russia as well as a reduction in advertising demand both within Europe and outside the region.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Facebook&rsquo;s Losing Revenue</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Facebook expects to lose $10 billion in revenue due to the changes in Apple's privacy settings on iOS. Apple introduced a new feature earlier this year that limits advertisers' access to the unique IDFA code associated with users' devices. That identifier is what gives companies a way to link a user to their Facebook data and show them targeted ads.</p>
<p>Facebook even rolled out prompt asking users to allow the company to track their activity across websites and apps before the change was implemented in hopes to curb its effects on the company's business.</p>
<p>A Meta spokesperson told the publications: &ldquo;<em>We regularly re-evaluate our talent pipeline according to our business needs and in light of the expense guidance given for this earnings period, we are slowing its growth accordingly. However, we will continue to grow our workforce to ensure we focus on long-term impact.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Privacy Standards of Mental Health Apps</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new analysis cites that as a category, mental health apps have worse privacy protections for users than other types of apps. The analysis was generated by researchers at Mozilla. The team also found that prayer apps also have poor privacy standards.</p>
<p>According to Jen Caltrider, the Mozilla *Privacy Not Included <u><a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/categories/mental-health-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guide </a></u>lead: &ldquo;<em>The vast majority of mental health and prayer apps are exceptionally creepy. They track, share, and capitalize on users&rsquo; most intimate personal thoughts and feelings, like moods, mental state, and biometric data.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>&lsquo;Privacy not Included&rsquo;</strong></h2>

<p>In the latest iteration of the guide, the team analyzed 32 mental health apps, including some prayer apps. Of those apps, 29 were given a &ldquo;<strong><em>privacy not included</em></strong>&rdquo; warning label, indicating that the team had concerns about how the app managed user data. The apps are designed for sensitive issues like mental health conditions, yet collect large amounts of personal data under vague privacy policies, the team said in the statement.</p>
<p>Most apps also had poor security practices, letting users create accounts with weak passwords despite containing deeply personal information. The apps with the worst practices, according to Mozilla, are Better Help, Youper, Woebot, Better Stop Suicide, Pray.com, and Talkspace. The AI chatbot Woebot, for example, says it collects information about users from third parties and shares user information for advertising purposes. Therapy provider Talkspace collects user chat transcripts. The Mozilla team said in a statement that it reached out to the companies behind these apps to ask about their policies multiple times, but only three responded.</p>
<p>In-person, traditional mental health care can be hard for many people to find &mdash; most therapists have long waiting lists, and navigating insurance and costs can be a major barrier to care. The problem got worse during the COVID-19 pandemic when more and more people started to need care. Mental health apps sought to fill that void by making resources more accessible and readily available. But that access could come with a privacy tradeoff, the report shows.</p>

Unlike in the past when organizations and hiring managers demanded a college degree to hire candidates, companies do not ask for degrees anymore. In fact, organizations like Google, Microsoft, and others are some of the leading companies that don&rsquo;t ask for a degree. In this blog, we have compiled a list of 10 companies that don&rsquo;t ask for a degree while hiring in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed with our list of companies that don&rsquo;t ask for degree, let us look at some of the shifting trends in technology that has caused this &lsquo;no-degree for jobs&rsquo; era in the industrial domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest Shifts in Technology</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Career development platforms including LinkedIn and Glassdoor note an increasing move away from degree requirements in technology industry hiring practices. For tech companies, applicants&rsquo; skills and abilities are often more important than their degree-based credentials. This shift also removes barriers to employment, leading to more equitable job access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tech employers may still consider a job-seeker&rsquo;s formal education when looking at their profile. However, many now place more importance on demonstrated hard skills than college degrees. Bootcamp education, industry-standard certifications, and self-taught abilities have all emerged as viable alternatives to a degree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For tech companies, applicants' skills and abilities are often more important than their degree-based credentials. Even so, the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation found that workers without a degree tend to experience an earnings gap compared to workers with one or more degrees. However, the 2019 whitepaper reported that this gap is 15% smaller for workers in tech than their peers in other industries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Salary data only tells part of the story. Professionals who do not earn degrees can enter the workforce more quickly. This may boost workers' career-long earning potential. Skipping college also means skipping student loans. Did you know that the typical bachelor's graduate of a public university is $28,600 in debt?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple industry sources report that the COVID-19 pandemic triggered sharp increases in the number of available technology jobs as companies and institutions adopted remote formats in mass numbers. Tech employers shifted to more inclusive hiring practices in part to address large numbers of job vacancies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>134:Tb0c,<p>In a piece of recent news, <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048481/california-plastic-recycling-myths-investigation-exxon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">California will investigate</a></strong> whether fossil fuel companies have broken the law by perpetuating myths about plastic recycling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Scrutinization of Fossil Fuel Companies</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that California will investigate whether fossil fuel companies are abiding by the law or not. The investigation on the fossil fuel companies mark a fresh attempt to hold the industry accountable for downplaying the harm their products inflict on the planet. Additionally, California will be looking into whether the fossil fuel companies have misled consumers into thinking that recycling keeps plastic out of landfills and ecosystems and whether they&rsquo;ve broken any laws in the process.</p>
<p>The reality is that the vast majority of plastic. More than 90% of all plastic ever made, never gets recycled. In a <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-investigation-fossil-fuel-and-petrochemical">press release</a>, Bonta said: &ldquo;<em>Enough is enough. For more than half a century, the plastics industry has engaged in an aggressive campaign to deceive the public, perpetuating a myth that recycling can solve the plastics crisis</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Recycling Difficulty </strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plastic is actually difficult to recycle (more so than some other materials) and degrades each time it gets rehashed. That&rsquo;s one reason why it&rsquo;s unlikely your plastic bottle will become another bottle. If it does get reused, it&rsquo;s more likely to wind up as fibers in carpeting, which doesn&rsquo;t require such high-grade plastic. And it often costs more to recycle plastic than to toss it, burn it or just make more new plastic.</p>
<p>Plastic makers anticipated these troubles with their products decades ago, according to a 2020 investigation by NPR and PBS Frontline, but promoted recycling as a viable solution to plastic waste anyway.</p>
<p>Plastic&rsquo;s popularity has skyrocketed over the past several decades. The world produces about 200 times more plastic today than it did in the 1950s. California&rsquo;s investigation will probe companies&rsquo; role in perpetuating myths around recycling and the extent to which this deception is still ongoing and determine whether their actions broke the law.</p>

The search engine giant is letting users limit how many ads they see about dating, pregnancy, parenting, and weight loss, and making those settings apply to more places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Google&rsquo;s New Feature</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s new feature was introduced as a way to let people see fewer ads on YouTube about potentially addictive gambling or alcoholic products, but now it seems that Google is expanding it to cover other potentially uncomfortable or traumatic subjects. Your settings will now apply to all of Google&rsquo;s Display network, not just YouTube ads, according to Elijah Lawal, a spokesperson for the company. Google says the network is &ldquo;a group of more than 2 million websites, videos, and apps&rdquo; that advertisers can target users across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Activating Google&rsquo;s New Feature</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access Google&rsquo;s new feature, go to your Ad Settings page and scroll to &ldquo;Sensitive ad categories on YouTube.&rdquo; From there, you can click the &ldquo;See Fewer&rdquo; button next to whatever categories you prefer. The page will warn you that you&rsquo;ll still see the same number of ads overall, and ask you to confirm the choice. You can also &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; categories you&rsquo;ve previously limited in the past.</p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s support page for the sensitive ad categories feature does note that, while it should show you fewer ads for products in each category you&rsquo;ve chosen to limit, the topics may still appear in other ads. It gives the example of &ldquo;an airline ad featuring someone drinking a glass of champagne.&rdquo; The company also notes that it &ldquo;does not allow advertisers to personalize ads based on certain topics, like alcohol and gambling, but you may see ads about these things based on related interests,&rdquo; such as beer makers targeting sports fans.</p>
<p>While gambling and drinking probably don&rsquo;t make a ton of appearances in general-audience ads, some of the newly added categories could be trickier to avoid. An ad for gum may feature people in a relationship, or an ad for razors may bring up the idea of fatherhood. Google&rsquo;s support page implies that you could still see these types of ads even if you&rsquo;ve asked to limit them &mdash; you just shouldn&rsquo;t get ads for, say, a dating app or diapers (unless, of course, the video you&rsquo;re watching has a sponsor spot for those things baked in).</p>

However, it is often various businesses make several common marketing mistakes that hinder their growth and prevent them from reaching their marketing goals.</p>
<p>Every marketer makes (some) mistake. With so many things on their plate, like managing a team, analyzing results, optimizing sites, and many more, errors are bound to come the way. Furthermore, it can cost up to thousands of dollars to fix a single marketing mistake. However, these frequent errors can be avoided. <strong><em>In this blog, we will cover 5 common marketing mistakes and how to fix them. </em></strong></p>
<p>Before we get started with the common errors in marketing strategies, let us shed light on why marketing strategies are vital for businesses, whether they are B2B or B2C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why strategies for marketing are important?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketing strategies help understand and communicate with your audience in a better manner. It&rsquo;s your guide to who you target, how you talk about your business, and how you differentiate yourself from all other businesses in your industry. It is the strategic foundation of your marketing house.</p>
<p>Moreover, a marketing strategy builds brand loyalty and customers for life while giving you a clear path to follow and a concise way of explaining your value to others. Therefore, it is vital for scaling success for any business.</p>
<p>However, several marketers often tend to make some common mistakes while ideating marketing strategies for their businesses. These common marketing errors create a barrier to their growth and success. In this blog, we will learn the 5 common marketing mistakes made by businesses and the methods to fix them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>5 Common Marketing Mistakes</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>1. Targeting the wrong audience. </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can have the most impactful campaign, sales copy as well as a funnel. However, the right eyes are not eying it and need to see it. Targeting the wrong set of audiences is one of the most common marketing mistakes made by businesses of all sizes. A wrong set of target audiences can decelerate the purpose of the campaign. Moreover, every campaign needs to be tailored according to the requirements and preferences of the audience. Therefore, it is vital to personalize marketing strategies according to the preferences of the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The fix:</strong></h4>
<p>Be empathetic, and research what customers care about. Using surveys and questionnaires to directly connect with customers is an effective and helpful solution and Google Forms is a great tool to use for this. Ask questions about their purchasing experience, interests, pain points and needs.</p>
<p>Additionally, make use of free platforms like Google Analytics to collect customer data. Market reports, case studies, white papers and other secondary resources are great for improving targeting, too. All of your findings need to be used to create specific buyer personas. Tailor calls to action, sales copy and landing pages to each group for maximum return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Not being consistent. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marketing is about consistency.&nbsp; A consistent look and feel to your materials, the tone of your brand language, and the cadence with that you produce and publish content is the only way to achieve good results.</p>
<p>If you hire a stellar agency to create lead generation assets but do not update your brand (e.g. website, logo, product materials) or overall message you are setting yourself up for failure. Your marketing establishes the initial impression your customer has of your company and you must carry that brand promise through the experience of delivering your product or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The fix:</strong></h4>
<p>In marketing, consistency is the king. You can be consistent by engaging with your customers on social media daily. Responding and reacting to their comments or posts can help boost engagement. With this knowledge in tow, you can more easily understand which content is driving engagement and which posts are dropping followers. You can also make content creation a daily habit to help you with maintaining consistency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>3. Not Launching Campaigns on time. </strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The perfect campaign can only make the desired impact and generate the desired outcome only when it is launched at the appropriate time. If a campaign is pushed back, that means results and revenue will be, too. Not good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The fix:</strong></h4>
<p>Every blunder can be fixed. Likewise, you can fix this common marketing mistake in two ways. Firstly, set clear milestones for every project, no matter how big or small. These might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a project outline.</li>
<li>Setting key performance indicators (KPIs).</li>
<li>Choosing the target audience.</li>
<li>Setting budget requirements.</li>
<li>Deciding on distribution and marketing channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondly, run the plan by your entire team so everyone is accountable. Ensure that every person and the department has their own milestones and KPIs. Lastly, check-in every set period (weekly, for example) to ensure that the campaign is progressing as planned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>4. Overspending on campaigns.</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be honest. Have you ever started an advertising campaign and spent way over budget? The most likely culprit is that you simply left the campaign on or didn&rsquo;t set a limit. If it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet, consider yourself lucky. Overspending on campaigns and their promotions is a very common marketing mistake made by marketers.</p>
<p>Either way, one of the first ways to avoid this happening is by having a clear checklist for each campaign. It might look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set campaign goals (leads, traffic, etc.).</li>
<li>Set a daily/monthly budget.</li>
<li>Produce sales copy and creatives.</li>
<li>Double-check settings.</li>
<li>Launch campaign.</li>
<li>Check in at least once per day.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>5. Broken Forms, Links And Checkout Systems</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of a sales funnel as individual steps that lead to the end goal: the sale. Every single step needs to be as easy and streamlined as possible. This maximizes how many users will convert. This is because it makes their experience smoother and more enjoyable. If there are constant bugs, interruptions and hiccups, they&rsquo;ll be clicking the back button as fast as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The fix:</strong></h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s typical for little things along the way to get messed up. That&rsquo;s OK. However, they can cost you leads and sales. There&rsquo;s one simple way to avoid this: Test your funnels! Yes, it&rsquo;s really that simple. Nothing should get launched without thorough testing. Go through the funnel, and click every button and link. Engage with the page as a real customer would. Ask yourself questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do the forms work?</li>
<li>Are links correct and functional?</li>
<li>Do buttons work?</li>
<li>Are pages responsive on all devices?</li>
<li>Can payments be sent and received properly?</li>
<li>Do cart and checkout systems work?</li>
</ul>
<p>Fix anything that isn&rsquo;t working as intended, and get important pages perfect. Once everything is greenlit, launch it with confidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>So, what did we learn?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above-mentioned common marketing mistakes can cost you a lot (if not managed and tackled well). Many of these can be prevented by having thorough systems and steps in place. Double-check progress, integrations and settings on a regular basis. Nothing will slip through the cracks this way. Test every page, product and funnel before it&rsquo;s offered to the public, as well. Obvious bugs will hurt customer experience, performance and branding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Reddit Community Funds Program</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its announcement, Reddit said: &ldquo;<em>We will invite communities to submit ideas for projects, events, contests, giving, almost anything you can think of to bring people together for inspiration and delight</em>.&rdquo; With that said, the projects can ask for between $1,000 and $50,000, and Reddit will start issuing grants in June.</p>
<p>In a way, the Reddit Community Funds program is the version of the creator funds that Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, and, well, pretty much everybody has been offering to people using their platforms. And, in that sense, Reddit&rsquo;s commitment here is pretty small: Facebook pledged to spend $1 billion on creator-related funding, and Snap was at one point throwing $1 million a day at the things people were making on the platform. There are a lot of places to make things online, and one way to get them to make them for you is to back a dump truck full of money up to their house!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Ginning Up Interest in Projects</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The money surely helps gin up interest in those projects (and, by extension, gets more people using Reddit) but in a slightly more circuitous way than your average &ldquo;thanks for going viral, here&rsquo;s some money!&rdquo; creator fund.</p>
<p>Though it might also be a way for Reddit to create its own kind of viral hits; those BTS billboards were big news, for instance, and a win for Reddit and its community-first story. For a company often thought of as a place for trolls, memestockers, and assholes, every heartwarming story about a cool community doing cool work is a big win. It&rsquo;s going to be fascinating to see which kinds of projects Reddit funds in the Reddit Community Funds program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Decoding Black Hole Information Paradox</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, scientists are puzzled by Hawking&rsquo;s black hole information paradox theory. However, recently, a team of researchers has published two studies proposing that black hole feature &lsquo;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269322001290" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum hair</a>&rsquo;. These &lsquo;quantum hair&rsquo; led scientists to break out of this decades-old conundrum which highlighted possible inconsistencies between <u><a href="https://www.space.com/17661-theory-general-relativity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity</a></u> and <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quantum mechanics</a></u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>&lsquo;Quantum Hair from Gravity&rsquo;</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Titled &lsquo;<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.128.111301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quantum Hair from Gravity</a>&rsquo;, researchers from the&nbsp; University of Sussex, University of Bologna and Michigan State University have collaborated on this project. Their collective work attempts to integrate Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity and quantum mechanics by utilizing new mathematical formulae developed during the last decade. If the notion of &ldquo;quantum hair&rdquo; does prove true, it would be a significant finding for theoretical physics, while eliminating the need to radically rethink how we see the universe.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.livescience.com/33816-quantum-mechanics-explanation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the laws of quantum mechanics</a>, information that exists in our universe cannot be destroyed, and this conservation of &ldquo;quantum information&rdquo; is fundamental to the universe. However, black holes present a challenge to these laws. This is because they are regions of spacetime nothing&mdash;not even light&mdash;can escape them due to strong gravitational force. The real question here is where does that sucked information go? This question serves as the crux of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/netta-engelhardt-has-escaped-hawkings-black-hole-paradox-20210823/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hawking&rsquo;s black hole information paradox theory</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Crux of Black Hole Information Paradox</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quantum Hair from Gravity&rsquo; paper addresses part of this question by showing that there are actually more to black holes than previously thought in classical physics. According to them, <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">black holes are actually more complex</a> and &lsquo;hairier&rsquo; than general relativity can comprehend. They are more than being mere simple objects with a certain mass, speed and rotation. This is because as the matter is sucked into a collapsing black hole, a barely imperceptible imprint (a quantum hair) is left in its gravitational field. It is this quantum imprint that serves as the mechanism for preserving information at the quantum level.</p>
<p>Working under the notions of classical physics, it would be considered impossible to go back in time to differentiate between the two stars, given the similar final states of the two black holes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting on June 1st, the cost of the all-access plan is going up by $5 per month to $44 in the US and by $6 CAD to $55 in Canada, as CNBC reports. The company won't change pricing for users elsewhere for now. The cost of the digital-only plan will remain the same.</p>
<p>Peloton will cut prices on some of its products. The price of the Bike will be reduced from $1,745 to $1,445 (which includes shipping and setup). The company is lowering the price of Bike+ by $500 to $1,995. As for Tread, Peloton is cutting the price by $200 to $2,695. The company is hoping that reducing the upfront cost of its fitness equipment will lower the barrier to entry and help it find more customers. "The pricing changes being announced today are part of CEO Barry McCarthy&rsquo;s vision to grow the Peloton community,&rdquo; a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Significant Drop in Share Price</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peloton's share price has dropped significantly over the last year, in part due to a pandemic-driven spike in demand for its products tapering off. Reports earlier this year suggested Peloton had thousands of products sitting in warehouses and on cargo ships and that it was changing its production levels. In February, Peloton replaced its CEO at the same time it cut 2,800 jobs (around 20 percent of its corporate workforce).</p>
<p>Only a few days before that, rumors suggested the likes of Amazon, Apple and Nike were interested in buying the company. By shaking up the pricing structure, Peloton is hoping it can correct course. Focusing on recurring revenue from subscriptions and lowering the cost of hardware could help. The company had already showed a willingness to reduce the price of its devices. It started selling the Peloton Guide set-up camera (which comes with its heart-rate monitor) this month for $295. It initially said the system would cost $495.</p>

The <strong><a href="%20https:/www.engadget.com/thermophotovoltaic-cell-converts-40-percent-of-heat-energy-to-electricity-101051572.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cells have the potential</a></strong> to be used in grid-scale "thermal batteries," generating energy dependably with no moving parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>What are Thermophotovoltaic cell?</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thermophotovoltaic cells work by heating semiconducting materials enough to significantly boost the energy of photons. At high enough energies, those photos can kick an electron across the material's "bandgap," generating electricity. So far, thermophotovoltaic cells have achieved up to just 32 percent efficiency because they operate at lower temperatures.</p>
<p>By contrast, the new design from MIT and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) takes power from white-hot heat sources between 1,900 to 2,400 degree Celsius (3,452 to 4,352 degrees F). To do that, it uses "high-bandgap" metal alloys sitting over a slightly lower-bandgap alloy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high-bandgap layer captures the highest-energy photons from a heat source and converts them to electricity, while lower-energy photons pass through the first layer and add to the voltage. Any photons that run the two-layer gauntlet are reflected by a mirror back to the heat source to avoid wasting energy. This is an absolutely critical step on the path to proliferate renewable energy and get to a fully decarbonized grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Measuring Efficiency Using Heat Flux Sensor</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Measuring the efficiency using a heat flux sensor, the team found that power varied with temperature. Between 1,900 to 2,400 degrees Celsius, the new thermophotovoltaic design produced electricity with about 40 percent efficiency. Steam turbines can deliver the same efficiency, but are far more complicated and restricted to lower temperatures.</p>
<p>"One of the advantages of solid-state energy converters are that they can operate at higher temperatures with lower maintenance costs because they have no moving parts," MIT Professor Asegun Henry told MIT News. "They just sit there and reliably generate electricity."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Grid-scale Thermal Battery</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a grid-scale thermal battery, the system would absorb excess energy from renewable sources like the sun and store it in heavily insulated banks of hot graphite. When needed, the thermophotovoltaic cells could then convert that heat to electricity and send it to the power grid. The experimental cell was just a square centimeter, so the team would have to ramp that up to around 10,000 square feet for grid-level power, but the technology already exists to create cells on that scale, Henry notes. "Thermophotovoltaic cells were the last key step toward demonstrating that thermal batteries are a viable concept," he said. "This is an absolutely critical step on the path to proliferate renewable energy and get to a fully decarbonized grid."</p>

Kendi and Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Working in Coordination</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Public Library worked in coordination with the publishers and authors to make the titles available to the public for free, with no wait times or download limits. Normally publishers allow libraries to only lend out e-books to a single person at a time, often leading to long hold times at public libraries.</p>
<p>While the titles are only available for a month (the titles will disappear by the end of May), interested readers don&rsquo;t need to hold an NYPL library card or live in the region. The books will be released through NYPL&rsquo;s &ldquo;Books For All&rdquo; program, which makes hundreds of titles in the public domain available to anyone nationwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Voicing opposition</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Public Library has voiced its opposition to a recent spike in book banning across school districts nationwide, largely driven by conservative activists groups. Over the last nine months, more than 1,000 books have been banned or temporarily pulled from school districts, according to a report PEN America released this week. &ldquo;These recent instances of censorship and book banning are extremely disturbing and amount to an all-out attack on the very foundation of our democracy,&rdquo; said New York Public Library President Anthony W. Marx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>The New York Public Library</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1999 young adult novel Speak, about a ninth grade girl who has refused to talk since being raped at a party, is included in ALA&rsquo;s list of 100 most challenged books between 2000 and 2009. Parents often voice opposition to its graphic, sexual content. King and the Dragonflies, about a middle school boy who struggles with the loss of his brother and his sexual identity, is the winner of the 2020 National Book Award for Young People&rsquo;s Literature, was flagged for removal in Keller, Texas. Stamped was challenged by parents in Round Rock, Texas last year, in part due to a tweet by by its author that criticized then-Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>Angela Montefinise, vice-president of communications and marketing, told Engadget in an email that the SimplyE app had to increase its server capacity three times today to account for the spike in downloads. Currently there are no future plans to release any more banned titles on the app. &ldquo;At this point we&rsquo;re not planning to release more books as part of this project, but we&rsquo;ll see how things go,&rdquo; wrote Montefinise in an email.</p>13c:Td89,<p>According to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, employees were told that the company was still <strong><a href="https://www.news18.com/news/explainers/explained-how-will-twitters-board-handle-elon-musk-5006065.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evaluating Musk&rsquo;s stake</a></strong> on Twitter board. The $43 billion offer by Elon Musk to buy the company and take it private is currently under evaluation, and is setting the stage for a potentially drawn-out feud with the world&rsquo;s richest person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Evaluation of Musk&rsquo; stake on Twitter board</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After clips of the songs &ldquo;I Say A Little Prayer&rdquo; and &ldquo;I Want It That Way&rdquo; by the Backstreet Boys played, Agrawal launched into a 25-minute Q&amp;A session with employees Thursday, according to a person in attendance. He didn&rsquo;t say when the board would have an answer to Musk&rsquo;s offer or which way it was leaning, frustrating some who expected a more detailed explanation. The board would follow a &ldquo;rigorous process&rdquo; and make a decision &ldquo;in the best interest of our shareholders,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Agrawal, who took over as CEO of Twitter last November for Jack Dorsey, fielded concerns from employees about the future of the social network if Musk were to take it over. At least one employee asked about the possibility of future layoffs, which Agrawal said wouldn&rsquo;t be dictated by individual performance ratings. In response to another question about what would happen to employee stock options if Twitter was taken private, he said it was too early to speculate. The emergency call was held during a &ldquo;focus week&rdquo; for Twitter employees, in which they had Monday off and were encouraged to be heads-down on projects and take few meetings.</p>
<p>Prior to the meeting, Musk had criticized the possibility of board action against the deal, saying it &ldquo;would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote.&rdquo; In an interview earlier in the day at the TED 2022 conference in Vancouver, Musk said his bid wasn&rsquo;t about making money and that he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;care about the economics at all.&rdquo; Instead, he said he wanted Twitter to protect &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; and open up its algorithm to outside scrutiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Strategies for refuting hostile takeover attempts</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, Agrawal&rsquo;s remarks suggest Twitter won&rsquo;t bend to Musk&rsquo;s whims easily and that a messy, Succession-style corporate battle could play out in the coming days. Twitter&rsquo;s board could choose to field other offers for the company or adopt a poison pill &mdash; a common strategy for refuting hostile takeover attempts. Musk, meanwhile, told the audience at TED on Thursday that he had a &ldquo;plan B&rdquo; should Twitter reject his offer.</p>
<p>Even if Twitter succeeds in defending against Musk this time, employees are already wondering if it can withstand future takeover attempts. At one point during the all-hands, Agrawal demurred when an employee asked: &ldquo;Are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to our board?&rdquo;</p>

"<em>We're going to move to . . . scale that no company has ever achieved in the history of humanity</em>," he said. Among the planned future product will be a dedicated robotaxi [that] is gonna look quite futuristic, and the Tesla robot Optimus, he said, which will help create "<em>an age of abundance . . . that's gonna transform the world to an extent even greater than the cars.</em>" This, too, he said is coming next year. Following that announcement, Musk rolled out the first Texas-built cars next to a sign saying "<em>Deliveries begin now</em>."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Tesla Cybertruck</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Showing the Cybertruck, he said, "It's been an intense couple years, but we're gonna have this for you next year, and it's gonna be great." He and design chief Franz von Holzhausen pretended to consider, then reject, the idea of smashing its window with a hammer as they famously did at the original reveal of the Cybertruck in 2019. Musk also doubled down on his enthusiasm for Full Self-Driving, saying it will "revolutionize the world," and promised that it will go into wider beta usage during 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Upcoming Manufacture of Tesla Cybertruck</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Giga Texas facility near Austin where Tesla expects to build the Cybertruck is having a big party tonight. Musk promised he would have an announcement as part of the grand opening festivities. There is speculation he will have more to say about the truck.</p>
<p>At the time the plant was first announced, in 2020, Musk said the 2500-acre facility will be where Tesla will build Model 3 and Model Y vehicles that will be delivered to the East Coast, along with the Tesla Semi and the Cybertruck. More recently, the company acknowledged that 2022 would not see any Semi or Cybertruck vehicles built. In January Tesla took the edgy electric truck's production timeline off its website entirely and, until today, had not given further information about when (or if) it will be built.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Amazon Union Elections Objection</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its filing to the National Labor Relations Board, Amazon (AMZN) alleges how the independent federal agency's regional office which oversaw the election at its Staten Island facility, known as JFK8, "unfairly and inappropriately facilitated the [Amazon Labor Union's] victory."</p>
<p>It claims the agency used an "artificially reduced number" of employees in the voting unit to calculate whether ALU had garnered enough support to even hold an election. It also claims the agency delayed investigating what it calls "frivolous" unfair labor practice charges that it says were "exploited" by the union. And it alleges that the agency failed to properly staff the polls during the election, which ultimately "produced chaos and hours-long lines to vote on the first polling day, discouraging other employees from voting."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Outlining Alleged Misconduct</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amazon also outlines alleged misconduct on the part of ALU, the grassroots labor organization started by current and former employees of the facility. Among its claims about the ALU, it says the union unlawfully intimidated employees and "threatened violence against its detractors."</p>
<p>Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement Friday: "Based on the evidence we've seen so far, as set out in our objections, we believe that the actions of the NLRB and the ALU improperly suppressed and influenced the vote, and we think the election should be conducted again so that a fair and broadly representative vote can be had."</p>
<p>The Staten Island election marked the first time a group of US workers have successfully voted to form a union in the company's 27-year history. On Thursday, Amazon was granted a two-week extension on filing the proof to support its objections</p>

Recently, Twitter said that its ALT badge and improved image descriptions are now available globally, <strong><a href="https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/twitter-adds-alt-badges-to-images-changes-how-deleted-tweets-are-preserved-329198-2022-04-08" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accessibility features</a></strong> that will make alt text descriptions more prominent for all users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Twitter&rsquo;s Latest Feature</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Images that have text descriptions will get a badge that reads &ldquo;alt,&rdquo; and clicking on the badge will bring up the description. Twitter first announced changes were coming last month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As promised, the ALT badge and exposed image descriptions go global today,&rdquo; reads a tweet from Twitter&rsquo;s Accessibility account. &ldquo;Over the past month, we fixed bugs and gathered feedback from the limited release group. We&rsquo;re ready. You&rsquo;re ready. Let&rsquo;s describe our images!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As promised, the ALT badge and exposed image descriptions go global today. In its tweet, Twitter stated: &ldquo;Over the past month, we fixed bugs and gathered feedback from the limited release group. We're ready. You're ready. Let's describe our images! Here's how: https://t.co/bkJmhRpZPg https://t.co/ep1ireBJGt&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Accessing the ALT Badge and Image Descriptions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter provided step-by-step instructions for how to add the image descriptions in a blog post. Here is how you can access the ALT badge and the image description option on Twitter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>After uploading an image to a tweet, select Add description underneath the image</li>
<li>Enter a description of the image in the text box. The character count is in the corner of the box; you have 1,000 characters available</li>
<li>Click Save, and an ALT badge will appear in the corner of the image</li>
<li>If someone clicks on the ALT badge, the description should appear on-screen</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before Thursday&rsquo;s change, most users didn&rsquo;t necessarily have access to alt text descriptions unless using screen readers. Twitter first introduced image descriptions in 2016, but it could be hard to find where and how to add them. The company didn&rsquo;t have a dedicated accessibility team until late 2020, with workers who wanted to work on accessibility issues volunteering their time.</p>

<p><strong>Also Read: <a href="../big-data/embedded-tweets-small-significant-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How are Embedded Tweets a small yet significant change to Twitter?</a></strong></p>140:Tb4f,<p>Spotify has announced two major updates: a slew of new features coming to its <strong><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/spotify-car-thing-update-calls/" target="_blank">Car Thing device</a></strong> and the launch of Canvas looping videos on its mobile app. Both updates have begun rolling out to Spotify users. The Car Thing features will be limited to the U.S. and iOS users will get the update first. Android owners will get everything at a later date.Canvas has a greater reach as the videos will release in beta across the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada for the Spotify mobile app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>More hands-off control in the Car Thing</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Car Thing was designed as a more convenient way to control Spotify while you drive and that core functionality is being expanded. Owners will now be able to see incoming calls on their screen where they can either answer the call or dismiss it. Another big change is &ldquo;Add to queue&rdquo; which Spotify claims is one of its most requested features. It&rsquo;s essentially the same feature on the mobile app where you can add songs or podcasts to a tracklist, but now you can use your voice.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also going to be a new &ldquo;Add to queue&rdquo; icon on the touchscreen to add the song to a playlist or you can press and hold the dial to do the same thing. Other features include the ability to use your voice to ask Spotify for a personalized playlist and to control other media.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Looping recommendations</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Canvas videos appear to have been inspired by Tik-Tok as a way to help people discover new types of music. Every day, Spotify will recommend you 15 Canvas loops based on the music that you like. You can scroll through the personalized selection to hear a preview and the Canvas for each song. If you like what you see and hear, you can add the song to a playlist or follow the artist straight from the Canvas loop. The feature will also allow you to post the Canvas onto a social media app and have it loop in the background of a Story.</p>

<p>Canvas will be right on the mobile app&rsquo;s home screen and will be created by the artists themselves to offer a sneak peek into the creative process. The full list of artists that will be in the Canvas section is unknown, but Spotify did reveal singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo as one of them. Spotify didn&rsquo;t say how long Canvas videos will be; whether it&rsquo;s a 30-second loop or up to a 3-minute stream like TikTok.</p>

It&#39;s been a good few weeks for spotting distant objects in the universe. The HD1 is estimated to be only a few years young than the Big Bang which created our universe. So, what could this discovery and spotting possibly mean?</p>

<h2><strong>The distant Galaxy, HD1</strong></h2>

<p>As Forbes notes, Japanese researchers have detected what might be the most distant galaxy known to date. HD1 is far enough that its light is estimated to be 13.5 billion years old, or just 300 million years after the Big Bang. That makes it 100 million years older than the previous record-setter, GN-z11, and suggests it might have some of the very first (Population III) stars that emerged in the reionization following the universe&#39;s &quot;dark ages.&quot;</p>

<p>The team spotted HD1 using about 1,200 hours of observations between the Spitzer Space Telescope, Subaru Telescope, UK Infrared Telescope and VISTA Telescope. They verified the distance using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and the red hue was indicative of the extreme redshift you&#39;d expect from a very distant galaxy.</p>

<h2><strong>Checking Significance of Signal from HD1</strong></h2>

<p>Astronomers still want to double-check their results. The signal from HD1 has a 99.9 percent significance, but observers won&#39;t be sure until they have a significance of 99.999 percent or better. The researchers may get that opportunity when the James Webb Space Telescope takes a look at the galaxy using its infrared-focused sensors.</p>

<p>If scientists can confirm HD1&#39;s existence, that will raise numerous questions. HD1 doesn&#39;t fit easily into existing models of galaxy formation and suggests there were already extremely bright objects in the early universe. Not that the astronomy community would mind &mdash; this would help refine their cosmological models.</p>

Recently, the World Health Organization&rsquo;s European head said that the body was preparing for possible chemical assaults in Ukraine, in a sign it is taking warnings that have emerged from both the West and Moscow seriously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Concerns over Chemical Assaults in Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge: &ldquo;Given the uncertainties of the current situation, there are no assurances that the war will not get worse.&rdquo; He further added how WHO is concerned about the possible chemical assaults in Ukraine. He added, without providing further details, &ldquo;WHO is considering all scenarios and making contingencies for different situations that could afflict the people of Ukraine, from the continued treatment of mass casualties to chemical assaults.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the other hand, Western officials have repeatedly voiced fears that Russia may use chemical and biological weapons in Ukraine, with risks of spillover effects beyond the country. Russia&#39;s defense ministry has accused Kyiv, without providing evidence, of planning a chemical attack against its own people in order to accuse Moscow of using chemical weapons in the invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24 2022.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Providing relief support in Ukraine</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same speech, which was delayed due to an air raid siren in Lviv, Kluge said the WHO was coordinating with the European Union to triage patients arriving from Ukraine and arranging for them to be sent on for treatment within Europe. He said that the WHO has already delivered over 185 tonnes of medical supplies including material to support trauma across Ukraine and said a further 125 tonnes were on the way.</p>

<p>According to a WHO database, it was showed that there have been 91 attacks on Ukraine&#39;s health care infrastructure resulting in 73 deaths since the invasion began, without saying who was responsible.</p>

When Elon Musk mulled taking Tesla private in 2018, he posted on Twitter to tell the world about it. When he got stuck in traffic in 2016, he tweeted the idea of an underground tunnel system to alleviate &ldquo;soul-destroying&rdquo; congestion. And when he challenged President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to one-on-one combat last month, he broadcast it on Twitter. And now Musk is investing where his words pour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Elon Musk and Twitter</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and the world&rsquo;s wealthiest person, had bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter, the social media platform where he has over 80 million followers. The purchase appears to make Musk Twitter&rsquo;s largest shareholder, ahead of the 8.8% stake owned by the mutual-fund company Vanguard and dwarfing the 2.3% stake of Jack Dorsey, Twitter&rsquo;s former chief executive.</p>

<p>Musk&rsquo;s Twitter investment, which he has been accumulating since at least last month, was worth about $2.89 billion based on the closing price of the company&rsquo;s stock on Friday. But by the end of Monday, after news of his buy-in sent Twitter&rsquo;s share price soaring more than 27 percent, it was worth about $3.7 billion. The shares are a fraction of Mr. Musk&rsquo;s reported $270 billion-plus net worth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Musk and Twitter Penchant</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite his penchant for sharing everything on Twitter &mdash; from business ideas, insults and memes to, this past weekend, his experience at a famed Berlin nightclub &mdash; Mr. Musk was uncharacteristically mum on the purchase of the company&rsquo;s shares, at least initially.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh hi lol&rdquo; he tweeted on Monday without elaborating after news of his investment had spread across Twitter. Mr. Musk, 50, did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to comment.</p>

<p>Musk has bought into Twitter at a delicate time for the company, which is based in San Francisco. Mr. Dorsey stepped down as chief executive in November and plans to leave the company&rsquo;s board when his term ends this year, after facing down an activist shareholder and grappling with criticism from lawmakers and regulators about free speech, censorship and toxic content.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Facebook&rsquo;s Ineligibility for Russian disinformation</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to sources, Facebook failed to label 80% of articles on its platform promoting a fast-spreading conspiracy theory that the US is funding the use of bioweapons in Ukraine, according to a study released Friday by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH).</p>

<p>The nonprofit Russian disinformation research group studied a sample of posts from between 24 February and 14 March sharing external articles containing baseless claims about bioweapons. It found Facebook in 80% of cases failed to label posts as either &ldquo;missing context&rdquo;, containing &ldquo;partly false information&rdquo; or &ldquo;false information&rdquo; outright.</p>

<p>People are trying to take down Russian disinformation. The bioweapons theory began to spread in the early days of the war on Ukraine, among fringe QAnon accounts, ultimately making its way to larger platforms such as Fox News. The White House has condemned the myth, saying it may have been manufactured by Moscow to justify a possible use of chemical weapons against Ukraine. But it continues to spread across social media, including Facebook.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>NewsWhip for Hoaxes and False Claims</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CCDH researchers used the social analytics tool NewsWhip to identify more than 120 articles from external sites that had false or misleading claims about bioweapons labs or misrepresented statements made by US officials and found articles in the sample had received more than 150,000 likes, comments and shares on Facebook. CCDH has called on Meta to more thoroughly enforce its &ldquo;false information&rdquo; and &ldquo;partly false information&rdquo; labels and expand the use of its existing &ldquo;missing context&rdquo; label.</p>

<p>Facebook spokesman Kevin McAlister said the study from CCDH &ldquo;misrepresents the scale and scope of our efforts&rdquo;. &ldquo;In fact, we have the most robust system for fact-checking false claims of any platform and our fact-checking partners have debunked dozens of claims about the Ukrainian bioweapons hoax in several languages including Ukrainian, Russian, and English,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Past Studies</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previous studies published by CCDH found Facebook struggled to enforce its own rules surrounding the labeling of state-sponsored news sources. And it is not alone: another study from Media Matters for America found YouTube had not only failed to remove thousands of videos about the Biolabs theory but had also profited off them through monetized channels.</p>

<p>While some experts have conceded that Facebook is now stepping up to more thoroughly crackdown on state propaganda, others say disinformation will continue to spread on social media as long as it is baked into the views-driven business model.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 Vaccine has proven effective against fighting the virus and its fatalities. The general recommendation of the vaccine dosage is 2-3. However, we have been witnessing an outbreak in China lately. <strong><em>Does that indicate the necessity and urgency for a fourth dose?</em></strong></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2><strong>The seemingly eternal battle of China vs COVID-19</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/15/china/china-covid-outbreak-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html">another COVID-19 outbreak has instigated in China</a>. Tens of millions of people are living under lockdown in China as the country battles its worst COVID-19 outbreak since the early days of the global pandemic. This outbreak is probably the worst outbreak of all and has spread faster than the previous waves of less infectious variants. Moreover, daily cases of positive patients are skyrocketing from a few dozen in February to more than 5,100 on Tuesday -- the highest figure since the early 2020 outbreak in Wuhan.</p>

<p>The number may sound low compared to other countries, but it is alarmingly high for a nation that has attempted to stamp out outbreaks and chains of transmission with a strict zero-Covid policy throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>Prior to the outbreak in China, a few countries around the world had started reliving the stringent COVID-19 restrictions. This was mostly due to reasons like decline in number of cases, accelerated vaccine drives and awareness among people, and others. With China returning behind the bars of lockdown, it seems as if we would require something more than just vaccines and social restrictions. But, do we really have the urgency of a fourth dose?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What is the buzz around the urgency for a fourth dose?</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, Pfizer&#39;s CEO says the company is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-fourth-dose-booster-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla/">submitting data to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the urgency for a fourth dose of its COVID-19 vaccine</a>. While the shot Pfizer is currently producing with BioNTech still protects against severe disease, the drugmaker now believes another booster is needed to ward off infections. Quoting the urgency for a fourth dose, the Pfizer CEO, <strong>Albert Bourla</strong> added, &ldquo;<em>Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a fourth booster right now. The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It&#39;s not that good against infections.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Steven Danehy</strong>, a spokesperson for Pfizer, said Bourla was referring to early and preliminary data and pointed to a study announced in January examining both a fourth dose of the currently-authorized formulation as well as one designed to target the Omicron variant. In a statement, Danehy cited, &ldquo;<em>We will continue to collect and assess all available data and remain in open dialogue with regulators and health authorities to help inform a COVID-19 vaccine strategy as the virus evolves</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What are others quoting on this urgency for a fourth dose?</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A White House spokesperson referred inquiries about the submission to the FDA. A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment. In another interview, Bourla had previously described the company&#39;s submission as a significant package of data about the need for a fourth dose. His conclusions echo trends observed by health authorities around the world, who have studied vaccine effectiveness during the Omicron variant wave earlier this year.</p>

<p>A cohort study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month found vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 emergency room or urgent care visits had decreased to 66% among those who had received a third dose of one of the mRNA vaccines four to five months ago. The vaccine was 78% effective against COVID-19 hospitalizations among this group.</p>

<p>Beyond the fourth shot, Bourla said the company is attempting to create a new vaccine that will protect against all variants, including Omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year. He stated that the Omicron was the first one that was able to evade in a skillful way, the immune protection that we&#39;re giving. But also, we know that the duration of the protection doesn&#39;t last very long.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2><strong>How can we tackle the virus with an additional booster shot?</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Federal health officials have previously said an additional booster shot would likely be needed to head off new waves of the virus, though potentially not until the fall for most people. Dr. Peter Marks, who spearheads the FDA&rsquo;s top vaccines official, put forth his opinions on the same during an event hosted by the University of California San Francisco and Standford University in January 2022. During the interview, he stated that the hope would be that after our third shots we are able to get enough time out of them that we end up on essentially a yearly COVID-19 booster.</p>

<p>That timeline had been echoed by executives at Moderna, which is also racing to trial new versions of their COVID-19 vaccine it hopes regulators can greenlight ahead of a potential fall booster season. It is time to update the vaccine against the mutations that are currently circulating, and to improve the durability against those new variants of concern. But it does run into the challenge of those filings, thinks Moderna&#39;s president Stephen Hoge told investors last month. &nbsp;</p>

<p>However, officials have said the fourth dose timeline could be accelerated for groups more vulnerable to severe breakthrough infections as the virus continues to spread. &ldquo;<em>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to be hearing, if you do, any kind of recommendations that would be across the board for everyone</em>,&rdquo; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the president&#39;s chief medical adviser, told reporters last month.</p>146:T1f75,<p>Budget-friendly smartphones are a vital part of the smartphone market since everyone is unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on flagship phones offering high specs and features. Moreover, revamped budget flagship phones can be pricey for some buyers who are not interested to invest in better choices that fall beyond their budget constraints.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best budget phones offer a mix of performance within a price that makes them an excellent value without making buyers feel as if they are missing out on all of the great features of modern smartphones.</p>

</ol>147:Tdf7,<p>In a piece of recent news, the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-generic-restasis">US health regulators announced their approval on AbbVie Inc&rsquo;s Restasis</a>. For reference, Restasis is a widely recommended drug used for treating people with dry eye syndrome.</p>

<h2><strong>The First Generic Approval</strong></h2>

<p>On 2 Feb 2022, the<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.fda.gov/"><strong>US Food and Drug Administration</strong></a> (US FDA) approved the first generic version of <a href="https://www.abbvie.com/"><strong>AbbVie Inc</strong></a>.&rsquo;s dry-eye drug <a href="https://www.restasis.com/"><strong>Restasis</strong></a>, or cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion (eye drops).</p>

<p>According to <strong>Sally Choe</strong>, Ph.D. of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, &ldquo;<em>Restasis has been approved for use in the U.S. for nearly 20 years, but until today, there was no approved generic product of this drug that can help the millions of Americans who suffer from dry eyes</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><strong>The Acquisition Timeline</strong></h2>

<p>The approval was granted to <a href="https://www.viatris.com/en"><strong>Viatris Inc</strong></a> (<strong>VTRS.O</strong>), which was formed through the merger of generic drugmaker Mylan Pharmaceuticals and <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/"><strong>Pfizer Inc&#39;s</strong></a> (PFE.N) off-patent drug business in 2020. In 2017, Allergan had sought to shield the drug&#39;s patents from a federal administrative court&#39;s review by transferring them to a Native American tribe.</p>

<p>However, in 2019, the bid was subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court. Further in 2020, AbbVie acquired Restasis through its $36 billion acquisition of Allergan Inc in the same year. The acquisition was approved in the US nearly two decades ago.</p>

<p>In 2012, Restasis generated revenue of $1.29 billion for AbbVie, a 64% jump from a year earlier. According to analysts, the drug shows the potential to bring in revenue of $655.6 million in 2022.</p>

<h2><strong>Dry-eye Syndrome and Causes</strong></h2>

<p>Dry eye is a rather common syndrome among people. During the syndrome, a person&rsquo;s eyes are unable to produce tears due to a lack of adequate lubrication for the eyes. According to a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28705660/"><strong>National Health and Wellness Survey</strong></a>, 7% of the US population and around 19% of adults upto 75 years and older are approximately affected by dry eyes.</p>

<p>This can happen due to several reasons. For instance, dry eyes may occur if the eyes do not produce enough tears or produce poor-quality tears. This tear instability leads to inflammation and damage of the eye&rsquo;s surface. However, it is often considered to be driven by inflammation that suppresses tear production. Therefore, Restasis is recommended to treat it since the drug works to reduce inflammation.</p>

<h2><strong>Prescribed Usage of Restasis</strong></h2>

<p>According to the FDA, the generic cyclosporine ophthalmic emulsion will be available in 0.05% single-use vials. The drug is an immunosuppressive medicine, which works to increase tear production by helping reduce inflammation associated with dry eye.</p>

<p>The drug has not been shown to be helpful in patients who take topical anti-inflammatory drugs or have had punctual plugs implanted (tiny devices placed in the tear ducts), two other treatments are used to help alleviate the condition.</p>148:Tbbd,<p>In a piece of recent news, <strong>The New York Times (NYT)</strong> has purchased the popular word game <strong><a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle </a></strong>for an undisclosed seven-figure amount. The purchase deal was announced by the creator of the game over a <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1488263944309731329">Twitter </a></strong>statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Strategized Deal</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The free and simple game was created by a software engineer, <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish">Josh Wardle</a></strong>. The free and simple game was launched in October 2021. Ever since its release, Wordle has taken the internet by storm. According to Mr. Wardle, the game&rsquo;s success had been &lsquo;a little overwhelming&rsquo;. He further stated that he was incredibly pleased with the deal that was announced in a statement on Twitter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also quoted his admiration for the NYT&rsquo;s approach to their games and the way they treat their players. According to a <strong><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/wordle-new-york-times-games/">statement by the NYT</a></strong>, &ldquo;<em>The Times remains focused on becoming the essential subscription for every English-speaking person seeking to understand and engage with the world. New York Times Games are a key part of that strategy</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Our games already provide original, high-quality content and experiences every single day. Wordle will now play a part in that daily experience, giving millions more people around the world another reason to turn to The Times to meet their daily news and life needs.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>The Lucid Game</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the NYT, the game will initially remain free to play. Wordle challenges players to find a five-letter word in six guesses. Every day, a new puzzle is published. Players can post how quickly they solved the colorful grid on their respective social media platforms, without spoiling the answer for other players. This is the main reason, as per Mr. Wardle, that Wordle managed to capture the imagination of so many users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Users can play the game within a few minutes and begin by guessing any five-letter word. Users can remember the following points while playing the game:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>If any of the letters are in that day&#39;s word but in the wrong place, they turn gold</li>
	<li>If they are in the word in the right place, they turn green</li>
	<li>If they are not in the word, they turn grey</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Mr. Wardle, the NYT crossword and spelling games helped him get through the pandemic. He also stated that the NYT Games played a &lsquo;big part&rsquo; in Wordle&rsquo;s origins. &ldquo;<em>Hence, the deal feels very natural.</em>&rdquo;</p>149:T51b,<p>The World Bank hopes to raise $100 billion in donations for the International Development Association fund for poorer countries to address &ldquo;tragic reversals in development&rdquo; caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Malpass said the multilateral development bank forecasts global growth of 5.7% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022, but said the worsening disparities between advanced economies and developing countries had set back efforts to reduce extreme poverty by year, and in some cases decades.</p>

<p>&quot;Incoming high-frequency data points to slowing momentum in global activity, amid persistent supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19 surges,&quot; Malpass said.</p>

<p>&quot;The outlook is challenging for much of the developing world, with lagging vaccination rates rising, inflation, limited policy support, too few jobs, and shortages that extend to food, water and electricity.&quot;</p>

<p>Malpass said inequality was increasing dramatically, with per capita income in advanced economies expected to grow nearly 5% in 2021, but only 0.5% in low-income countries.</p>

<p>Malpass also called for efforts to address the unsustainable debt levels of many developing countries, noting that the debt burden of low-income nations rose 12% to a record $860 billion in 2020.</p>14a:T53e,<p>The demand for better broadband connectivity is driving many telecommunications operators to make a big push to expand their fiber footprints. According to a report from financial analysts at Cowen, in 2021 telecom operators, led by AT&amp;T, are expected to expand fiber to 5 million more homes, bringing the total homes passed in the US&nbsp;to approximately 42 million. The firm estimates that by 2025 that number could increase to 68 million homes passed with fiber, which means fiber would have a penetration rate of more than 50% in the US.&nbsp;AT&amp;T is at the forefront of the fiber push. Executives at the company told analysts at their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercetelecom.com/operators/at-t-will-expand-its-fiber-footprint-to-3m-additional-locations-year">annual investor event</a>&nbsp;that AT&amp;T will deploy fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) to an additional 3 million locations across 90 metro areas this year and add 4 million FTTP locations in 2022.&nbsp;But AT&amp;T isn&rsquo;t alone. Cowen analysts noted that Frontier Communications, which is in the process of emerging from bankruptcy, has plans to upgrade fiber to 3 million homes, which would double its existing fiber footprint. And the investment firm said that number could grow as high as 9 million FTTP homes depending on the economics.</p>

<p>it would have substantially reduced the use of plastic in the more than 1 billion children&#39;s toys it sells each year internationally. The modification entails replacing a plastic figurine of Batman, for example, with one composed of a dozen cardboard parts that children can assemble themselves. McDonald&#39;s has stated that more toys will be manufactured from recycled or plant-based plastics. The modifications will help the Chicago-based firm reduce its usage of virgin fossil fuel-based plastic for Happy Meals by 90% compared to 2018.</p>

<p>More than 100 countries worldwide sell Happy Meals at McDonald&rsquo;s locations. The burger chain&nbsp;began selling the meals in 1979. In 2018, after widespread concern about children&rsquo;s meals at fast-food restaurants, the company revamped its options to selections that were lower in calories, sodium, saturated fat and sugar.</p>

<p>McDonald&rsquo;s chief sustainability officer Jenny McColloch said the company has already been learning from feedback in France, the U.K. and Ireland, where the toys have already rolled out. The goal is to make sure they are safe and sturdy enough for children.</p>

<p>The newer options will also be &ldquo;cost neutral&rdquo; for franchisees because the effort was designed with the existing price in mind, Murray said. In the past, lower-plastic options have included Pokemon cards and books.</p>

<p>According to McColloch, the more sustainable toys will begin rolling out widely in the U.S. by January.</p>

<p>The fast-food giant is also looking for ways to recycle the old plastic Happy Meal toys within its restaurants. Its locations in the U.K. and Japan, for example, have reused the plastic for playgrounds and restaurant trays.</p>14d:T6a3,<p>Nippon Steel is seeking 20 billion yen ($176 million) in damages from each company, alleging the two firms have infringed on its patents on non-oriented magnetic steel sheets that are used in electric vehicles, it said in a statement.</p>

<p>Two of Japan&#39;s manufacturing giants, the country&#39;s biggest steelmaker and automaker, slugging it out in court is a rare occurrence and signifies the high stakes involved in materials production as the global low-carbon revolution takes hold.</p>

<p>&quot;Electrical steel sheets are indispensable materials for automobile electrification and are one of our key products aimed at helping decarbonisation for cars, electrical products and power plants&quot; a Nippon Steel spokesperson said.</p>

<p>This is the first time Nippon Steel has filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Toyota, the spokesperson added. Nippon Steel is a longstanding steel supplier for Toyota and other Japanese automakers.</p>

<p>&quot;We confirmed that there was no infringement of another company&#39;s patent before concluding a contract&quot; with Baosteel to supply electromagnetic steel sheets, Toyota said.</p>

<p>Nippon Steel, the world&#39;s fifth-biggest steelmaker by output, also filed a petition for a preliminary injunction prohibiting Toyota from manufacturing and selling motor-driven vehicles that use the electrical steel sheets allegedly violating its patents.</p>

<p>The company decided to take legal action after it could not reach a resolution through discussions with both companies, it said.</p>

<p>The steelmaker declined to give further details, including the names of the Toyota products and the size of their sales.</p>14e:Tbd2,<p>A clot in a blood vessel in the brain can cause an ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke remains one of the leading causes of death despite advanced treatment options such as thrombolytic therapy which dissolves blood clots and intravascular catheter treatment which mechanically removes a clot.</p>

<p>During and immediately following an ischemic stroke, inflammation causes tissue injury in its attempt to repair tissues resulting in a loss of neural tissue and neurological deficits. How such neuroinflammatory responses accompanying an ischemic stroke are coordinated in time and space is unclear.</p>

<p>Chigusa Nakahashi-Oda, PhD, and colleagues at the<a href=https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/>University of Tsukuba</a>, Japan, showed that mice that have either low levels of a phosphatidylserine receptor called CD300a, or where CD300a is pharmacologically blocked, suffer limited neurological deficits after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)&mdash;a condition that recapitulates an ischemic stroke.</p>

<p>The study is reported in the article,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.abe7915">&ldquo;CD300a blockade enhances efferocytosis by infiltrating myeloid cells and ameliorates neuronal deficit after ischemic stroke,&rdquo;</a>&nbsp;published in the journal&nbsp;Science Immunology. The findings point to ways of suppressing stroke-related inflammation at its earliest stages, which often results in brain damage and permanent impairment.</p>

<p>Within a few hours after an artery in the brain is blocked&mdash;during the super-acute phase of ischemic stroke&mdash;dead brain cells display a lipid called phosphatidylserine that acts as an &ldquo;eat me&rdquo; signal for the phagocytic cells, such as monocytes and microglia, that engulf and dispose of these dead cells, in a process called efferocytosis.</p>

<p>Efferocytosis is an intricate balance of &ldquo;find-me&rdquo;, &ldquo;eat-me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;don&rsquo;t-eat-me&rdquo; signals that quickly and efficiently remove membrane-bound apoptotic particles from the body before they can spill their contents of cytotoxic molecules and intracellular antigens into the circulation and cause havoc.</p>

<p>CD300a, abundantly expressed in blood cells in the brain, acts as a regulator of efferocytosis. It competes with its family member CD300b to bind phosphatidylserine, thus preventing the necessary signaling to trigger efferocytosis.</p>

<p>When levels of CD300a are low due to genetic manipulation or the receptor is inhibited by a neutralizing antibody, efferocytosis is increased by blood cells that infiltrate into the brain as early as one hour after blocking the middle cerebral artery, the authors reported. This increased efferocytosis reduces the release of molecules called DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) from the apoptotic cells and particles, which in turn reduces inflammation in the region surrounding the blocked artery and accompanying neurological deficits after the stroke.</p>14f:T5fc,<p>Oracle is now encouraging its customers to go all-in on the cloud. So many of the thousands of organizations currently operating Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) will soon be facing the end of premiere support for this on-premise ERP platform as the company pushes offerings like Oracle ERP Cloud. Specifically, Oracle premier support for EBS release 12.1 will be available through at least December 2021. This means that companies using Oracle EBS can continue to sustain their investments with minimal disruption for a few more months without losing access to new updates, security alerts, data fixes, certifications, and critical patch updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oracle recently announced that Oracle premier support for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) release 12.1 will be terminated after December 2021, meaning many organizations will be facing the end of premiere support for the on-premise ERP platform.</p>

<p>As Oracle moves to sustain support for these customers, EBS customers will not receive new fixes, updates, or patches. This means that for many, upgrading to EBS 12.2 is a must. EBS 12.2 will provide regular updates to improve functionality and features. Those still using running Oracle EBS 12.1 will need to implement an upgrade plan if they have not already.</p>

<p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure allows customers the ability to move to the cloud at a lower cost for virtual machines and storage. Customers can also roll database licensing costs into their monthly payments allowing for greater flexibility.</p>150:T66a,<p>U.S. refiners are expected to post higher profits for the third quarter as gasoline and diesel sales margins improved despite soaring crude oil costs, analysts said.</p>

<p>After more than a year of declining fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back at five-year averages in the United States, the world&rsquo;s largest fuel consumer. This has increased the margins on refined products to more than double what these companies were doing at the same time a year ago.</p>

<p>The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N) , are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.</p>

<p>These gains are due to the 3-2-1 crack gap, an indicator of refining margins, which assumes that one barrel of crude oil is refined into three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. This spread is currently $ 21 a barrel, down from about $ 9 a year ago.</p>

<p>Energy demand recovered quickly from the worst days of the pandemic in 2020, and prices for Brent and U.S. crude oil have hit multi-year highs in recent days. But the demand for products also increased, which helped to increase the margins.</p>

<p>Product supplied &ndash; an indicator of demand for refined products in the United States &ndash; was 21.5 million barrels per day in the most recent week, slightly higher than the same period in 2019, before the start of the pandemic, according to the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>151:T11ba,<p>Power shortages helped drive China&rsquo;s economic growth to its slowest pace in a year, while a hike in coal prices on Monday caused further damage to the Chinese industry and global supply chains.

<p>The Czech Republic&rsquo;s energy regulator took the extraordinary step of asking suppliers to provide assurances that they could supply electricity to homes and companies after one of the country&rsquo;s electricity and gas conglomerates stopped the supply.</p>

<p>Suppliers in other European markets, including the UK, have also been bent on rising energy prices in recent weeks.</p>

<p>In Asia, electricity provider Om Energy said on its website that it pulled out of the retail electricity market in Singapore on Friday, the third company to do so in recent weeks.</p>

<p>To ease China&rsquo;s woes, Beijing has taken several steps to boost production of coal, which fuels about 60% of its power plants. But Monday&rsquo;s data showed that those steps were taking time to complete, even as power demand continued to rise.</p>

<p>Official data showed China&rsquo;s coal production stood at 334.1 million tonnes last month, down from 335.24 million tonnes in August and 0.9% lower than a year ago.</p>

<p>That means September production averaged 11.14 million tonnes a day, a Businesshala calculation showed, compared with figures released last week that China said daily output was more than 11.2 million tonnes, in line with Beijing&rsquo;s efforts.</p>

<p>Under the partnership, SpaceX will locate Starlink ground stations within Google&rsquo;s data centre properties. This will provide a benefit of security, low latency, and reliable delivery of data from more than 1,500 Starlink satellites.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Google Cloud&rsquo;s high capacity private network will support the delivery of Starlink&rsquo;s global satellite internet service, bringing businesses and consumers seamless connectivity to the cloud and Internet, and enabling the delivery of critical enterprise applications to virtually any location,&rdquo;&nbsp;the companies wrote.</p>

<p>The service is aimed at organisations with broad footprints, such as public sector agencies, as well as businesses in rural or remote locations or, more widely, those with presence at the network edge. These clients utilise Starlink&rsquo;s constellation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites.</p>

<p>Regular readers of this publication will have seen Starlink&rsquo;s continued momentum. In March,&nbsp;<em>Telecoms&nbsp;</em>reported on the fourth Starlink launch in less than a month, taking the total to 240 satellites.</p>

<p>Both sides highlighted the dual benefits of the partnership, as was their wont, with Google Cloud emphasising the need for cloud transformation across remote coverage areas. &ldquo;Combining Starlink&rsquo;s high speed, low latency broadband with Google&rsquo;s infrastructure and capabilities provides global organisations with the secure and fast connection that modern organisations expect,&rdquo; added Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and COO in a statement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>153:T134e,<p>It&#39;s easy to&nbsp;chase high dividend stocks&nbsp;&mdash; and even easier to&nbsp;lose money on them if they fall. There&#39;s a better way to find high dividend yields you can count on to make you money &mdash; which includes stocks like materials company&nbsp;<strong>Rio Tinto</strong>&nbsp;(RIO) and financials like&nbsp;<strong>Federal Agricultural Mortgage</strong>&nbsp;(AGM)plus&nbsp;<strong>M.D.C. Holdings</strong>&nbsp;(MDC).</p>

<p>All things held equal, when a stock falls the dividend yield rises. In other words, if you own a company with a&nbsp;massive yield What&#39;s an investor looking for high dividend stocks to do then? Find stocks with market-beating yields and shares that at least keep pace with the market long term. That way you get a rich dividend that isn&#39;t eroded by a faltering stock price.that&#39;s rising, you&#39;re likely losing money on the underlying stock. That&#39;s not a successful long-term strategy. It&#39;s actually a common way to lose money.</p>

<p>To help you find such opportunities, Investor&#39;s Business Daily pinpoints high dividend stocks that yield at least 3%, which is 100% more than the&nbsp;Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s 500&nbsp;(yielding roughly 1.5%). But, just as importantly, they have a stock price that at least keeps up with the market.</p>

<h2>High Dividend Stocks: Math Distorts Reality</h2>

<p>A rising dividend yield may simply be masking a money-losing stock. Math and the way dividend yields are calculated is why this happens. The formula for dividend yield is:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Dividend yield = Annual dividend/Stock share price</h2>

<p>This is why&nbsp;chasing yield is often a bad idea when looking for high-dividend stocks. High yields are often a mathematical distortion of a declining stock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Chasing Yield Can Cost You Money</h2>

<p>In fact, 405 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 paid a dividend going into 2020, says S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Of those dividend-paying stocks, 167, or 40%, saw their shares fall enough during the year to wipe out the entire year&#39;s dividend yield, or worse. And that&#39;s in a good market for the S&amp;P 500. Nearly two-thirds of dividend stocks dropped by more than their yield in a less bullish 2018. And in 2019, 9% of S&amp;P 500 stocks that paid a dividend coming into the year are down more than that yield.</p>

<h2>High Dividend Stocks: IBD&#39;s Better Approach</h2>

<p>So, if chasing yield doesn&#39;t work, what does? One IBD strategy looks for high-dividend stocks with signs of stability going for them. Specifically, these stocks have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>High dividend yields of 3%-plus. That&#39;s more than 100% higher than the S&amp;P&#39;s 1.3% yield.</li>
	<li>Three- and five-year earnings growth of 10%-plus.</li>
	<li>Earnings stability of 20 or better. Earnings stability is measured by looking at how much earnings per share swings from the five-year trend. A lower number indicates more stability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>High Dividend Yield Winner: Rio Tinto</h2>

<p>When you&#39;ve narrowed down the list of high-dividend stocks this much, it&#39;s OK to look for the top dividend yields. That title goes to Rio Tinto. Based in London, Rio Tinto mines and processes materials ranging from aluminum to copper and diamonds. And it yields a lucrative 5.5%. Additionally, the company&#39;s yield is up more than 30% over the past five years.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s not just a high-yield wonder. The stock is up more than 57% in just the past 52 weeks. Commodity prices continue to jump as the economy slowly reopens. And the stock has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 149% over the past five years.</p>

<h2>Solid Source Of Dividend Yield: Federal Agricultural Mortgage</h2>

<p>Federal Agricultural Mortgage continues to be a rock-solid source of dividends you can count on. Based in Washington D.C., Federal Agricultural Mortgage operates a secondary market for a variety of loans. Those loans range from those to farms as well as USDA guarantees. The stock&#39;s Class C shares yield 3.5%, well above the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shares of&nbsp;Federal Agricultural Mortgage&nbsp;are up 190% over the past five years, or roughly 37% better than the S&amp;P 500. Earnings grew at an 12% annualized clip the past three years and are stable. On top of this, the company boosted its dividend by more than 33% the past five years.</p>

<p>Now, that&#39;s a reliable dividend.</p>

<h2>Housing Flexes Its Dividend Power</h2>

<p>The Denver-based homebuilder&#39;s 3.1% dividend yield calls out to income-seeking investors. But our analysis shows there&#39;s more to it than just a market-beating payout. Nearly 31% earnings growth the past five years and 26% earnings growth the past three show the builder is tapping new routes of expansion. Most promising is the builder, is committed to dividend growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>154:T1242,<p>According to the new market research report, &lsquo;Food Safety Testing Market by Type (Natural, Synthetic, Nature-Identical), Application (Food Products, and Beverages), Form (Liquid, Powder and Gel), Solubility (Dyes and lakes), and Region (North America, Asia Pacific, Europe) - Global Forecast to 2026&rsquo;, published by MarketsandMarkets, the market for Food Safety Testing is estimated at $19.5 billion in 2021; it is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7.9% to reach $28.6 billion by 2026.</p>

<p>Foodservice buyers worldwide have been affected tremendously by foodborne illnesses among consumers, and this has directed their attention toward obtaining certification of food safety assurance. Food manufacturers are willing to pay for testing and certification and have included this practice in their manufacturing cycles. Food companies, major retailers, and importers have been undertaking food safety testing to reduce the occurrence of foodborne diseases and legal conflicts as well. Food safety assurance has become important for food companies to comply with the global standards of food processing and labelling and meet the consumer demand for food safety.</p>

<p>Food safety testing is conducted at critical levels of production and works as an essential step in certifying the quality and safety of food items served to customers. In the US, food recalls occur frequently. As a result, food production, food service, and food retail companies, together with government regulators, have increased efforts to ensure food safety, leading to the growth of the food safety testing market.</p>

<p><strong>The pathogens sub-segment is estimated to account for the largest market share in the by target tested segment for food safety testing market.</strong></p>

<p>The pathogens segment is estimated to dominate the food safety testing market in 2021. Increasing instances of food contamination and foodborne poisoning are the major reasons for the growth of the pathogen testing market. The market for GMO testing is projected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period. An increase in consumer awareness for genetically modified organisms in food, stringent regulatory restrictions on GMOs, and efficient technological trends are expected to drive the global market for GMO testing.</p>

<p><strong>By technology, the rapid testing technology sub-segment is estimated to account for the fastest growth in food safety testing market.</strong></p>

<p>Low turnaround time, higher accuracy, sensitivity, and ability to test a wide range of contaminants in comparison to traditional technology are expected to drive the market for rapid technology. Further with increasing competition in the global markets the company&#39;s are launching newer and more advanced food testing methods and equipments which is driving the segment growth.</p>

<p><strong>The meat, poultry and seafood sub-segment by form is estimated to account for the largest market share of food safety testing market over the forecast period.</strong></p>

<p>The meat, poultry, and seafood segment is estimated to dominate the food safety testing market in 2021. The segment is projected to be the fastest-growing due to easy susceptibility to microbial and other contaminations along with the growing number of tests for meat, poultry, seafood products. Stringent government policies &amp; regulations for meat, poultry, and seafood products and assurance of safe meat to consumers have led to consistent food safety testing with checkpoints at different stages to eliminate any incidences of meat contamination.</p>

<p>Stringent Government policies and regulations for meat, poultry, and seafood products and assurance of safe meat to consumers have led to consistent food safety testing with checkpoints at different stages to eliminate any incidences of meat contamination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Europe is estimated to be the largest market.</strong></p>

<p>The market in this region is primarily driven by growth in the German and UK markets. It is also driven by European food policies that have been extensively emphasised by the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) and the European Reference Laboratories (EURLs) to maintain food standards and protect consumer health. The market is further fuelled by the presence of major food safety testing companies such as SGS SA (Switzerland), Eurofins Scientific (Luxembourg), and Intertek Group plc (UK), which are continuously investing and collaborating for the development of better and faster testing technologies to aid conformity to various food safety regulations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>155:Tca8,<p>(CNN) &mdash; AT&amp;T is in superior talks with Discovery Communications a couple of deal that might mix two treasure troves of content material within the streaming age.</p>

<p>AT&amp;T&rsquo;s WarnerMedia division, which incorporates CNN, could be paired with Discovery beneath a proposal that&rsquo;s being mentioned behind closed doorways this weekend, a supply conversant in the matter stated, confirming information first reported Sunday morning by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>If there are not any last-minute snags, the deal could possibly be introduced as quickly as Monday.</p>

<p>The mechanics and monetary phrases of the deal couldn&rsquo;t instantly be gleaned. Bloomberg stated &ldquo;the businesses are nonetheless negotiating the construction of a transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As is the norm throughout such negotiations, neither firm had a remark concerning the experiences on Sunday.</p>

<p>Outstanding Wall Road analysts have been predicting, and in some circumstances encouraging, AT&amp;T to spin or dump WarnerMedia and give attention to its wi-fi companies. That will be an abrupt change for an organization that solely accomplished its acquisition of WarnerMedia three years in the past.</p>

<p>WarnerMedia, recognized then as Time Warner, contained precious property like CNN, HBO, TNT, TBS, and the Warner Bros studio. Below AT&amp;T, WarnerMedia has centered on the expansion of its streaming service HBO Max, combining present programming from HBO with new content material from different components of the media empire.</p>

<p>Discovery has additionally prioritized its personal streaming platform, referred to as discovery+, with nonfiction fare from Animal Planet, TLC, and the opposite channels it owns.</p>

<p>If the 2 media corporations be part of forces, they could be higher geared up to compete with the likes of Netflix and Disney.</p>

<p>Discovery CEO David Zaslav alluded to this very chance in an interview with CNBC final December.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Inside the subsequent two years, it will be put up or shut up for all of us,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Are you able to present you are scaling? Are you going to be a participant within the U.S.? Are you going to be a participant all over the world?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He predicted consolidation: &ldquo;I feel finally a number of these corporations are going to understand, &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got sufficient.&rsquo; After which they will say, &lsquo;Who can we merge with or who can we do a cope with? And if we put collectively our IP, possibly we are able to compete with Disney.&#39;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Within the interview, Zaslav additionally complimented AT&amp;T CEO John Stankey and WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar, saying &ldquo;they&rsquo;re tremendous sensible guys&rdquo; and &ldquo;they have a number of nice property there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Warner-Discovery talks have resulted in additional questions than solutions: May different bidders come into play? Who would run the mixed content material powerhouse? Would CNN stay within the combine with the leisure manufacturers, or may or not it&rsquo;s bought?</p>

<p>The individuals who know aren&rsquo;t able to say fairly but.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>156:Tf48,<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider a major abortion case next term concerning a controversial Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks, rekindling a potentially major challenge to Roe v. Wade at the majority conservative court.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By hearing the case in their next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2022, the justices will look at whether to overturn a central part of the landmark ruling, a longstanding goal of religious conservatives.</p>

<p>In the Roe v. Wade decision, subsequently reaffirmed in 1992, the court said that states could not ban abortion before the viability of the fetus outside the womb, which is generally viewed by doctors as between 24 and 28 weeks. The Mississippi law would ban abortion much earlier than that.</p>

<p>The Roe v. Wade ruling recognized that a constitutional right to personal privacy protects a woman&#39;s ability to obtain an abortion. The court in its 1992 decision, coming in the case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, reaffirmed the ruling and prohibited laws that place an &quot;undue burden&quot; on a woman&#39;s ability to obtain an abortion.</p>

<p>Abortion opponents are hopeful that the Supreme Court will narrow or overturn the Roe v. Wade decision. The court moved from a 5-4 to a 6-3 conservative majority following Senate confirmation last year of Republican former President Donald Trump&#39;s third appointee, Justice Amy Coney Barrett.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court in a 5-4 June 2020 ruling struck down an abortion law in Louisiana that imposed restrictions on doctors who perform the procedure. The late liberal Justice Ruth Bader was still on the court at the time, and conservative Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the court&#39;s liberal wing in the ruling. Roberts at the time, however, made it clear that he voted the way he did because he felt bound by the court&#39;s 2016 ruling that struck down a similar law in Texas.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mississippi law, like others similar to it passed by Republican-led states, was enacted with full knowledge that was a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>After the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization, sued to try to block the measure, a federal judge in 2018 ruled against the state. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2019 reached the same conclusion, prompting the state to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>&quot;States may regulate abortion procedures prior to viability so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the woman&#39;s right, but they may not ban abortions. The law at issue is a ban,&quot; 5th Circuit Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote.</p>

<p>Abortion remains a divisive issue in the United States, as in many countries. Christian conservatives are among those most opposed to it. Abortion rates in the United States have steadily declined since the early 1980s, reaching the lowest levels on record in recent years, according to the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute.</p>

<p>The June 2020 ruling in the Louisiana case marked the court&#39;s first major abortion decision since Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Neil Gorsuch in 2017 as justices. Both voted in favor of Louisiana&#39;s restrictions. If Barrett were to vote on similar lines, conservatives could have a majority to curb abortion rights regardless of how Roberts votes. Trump had promised during the 2016 presidential race to appoint justices who would overturn Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>The Mississippi appeal had been pending at the court since June 2020 without the justices taking action on whether or not to hear it. During that time, Ginsburg died and was replaced by Barrett and Trump lost his re-election bid, to be replaced by Democratic President Joe Biden, who supports abortion rights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our products are plants made meatier, and deliver the same delicious flavours, in a better-for-you alternative,&rdquo; said David Ervin, vice president of marketing, Raised &amp; Rooted. &ldquo;We are excited to provide people with satisfying alternative protein options perfect for any occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Plants Made Meatier for Grilling Moments</strong></p>

<p>While there are more plant-based options available for consumers today, few are made for those looking to fire up their grills. In a recent survey, nearly half of Americans noted a desire for more satisfying, plant-based options for the grill.*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The brand is delivering on those desires with the introduction of its plant-based burger patties and sausages. Made from pea protein, and soy free, the new refrigerated plant protein options are chef inspired, with the seasoning and texture to deliver a mouthwatering taste experience for meat and plant eaters alike.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With 17g &ndash; 21g of protein per serving, the patties and sausages provide an excellent source of protein with 75 percent less saturated fat than traditional options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LONDON &mdash; Amazon won its appeal against the European Commission on Wednesday, who had ordered the U.S. tech giant to pay back 250 million euros ($303 million) in taxes to Luxembourg.</p>

<p>The EU&#39;s general court said that the commission, the EU&#39;s executive arm, had failed to prove that there was an illegal tax advantage given to Amazon by Luxembourg &mdash; where the U.S. firm has its European subsidiary.</p>

<p>The Brussels-based institution had said in 2017 that Luxembourg had granted undue tax benefits to Amazon. The commission said at the time that Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national rules. However, Amazon contested that assessment.</p>

<p>&quot;We welcome the Court&#39;s decision, which is in line with our long-standing position that we followed all applicable laws and that Amazon received no special treatment,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The European Commission was not immediately available for comment when contacted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=world">CNBC</a> on Wednesday. The institution can decide to appeal the court ruling and take the case to the EU&#39;s highest court.</p>

<p><strong><em>Why it matters?</em></strong></p>

<p>The latest court ruling is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/15/what-the-apple-ruling-means-for-the-eu-and-other-companies-operating-there.html?&amp;doc=106881717">second one</a>&nbsp;in the space of less than a year, where the outcome says the commission has not proven any tax advantage.</p>

<p>Back in July, the EU&#39;s general court said that the EU&#39;s team led by Margrethe Vestager failed to prove that the Irish government had given a tax advantage to Apple. The commission had ordered Apple to repay some 13 billion euros in unpaid taxes in 2016.</p>

<p>The commission has since then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/25/eu-appeals-against-apple-ruling-in-15-billion-tax-battle.html?&amp;doc=106881717">decided to take this case to the European Court of Justice</a>, while at the same time studying ways on how to sharpen up its toolkit to combat what it describes as unfair market competition.</p>

<p>In this context, European lawmakers are currently debating two legislative proposals which could bring about sweeping changes. Under these proposals, the EU&#39;s aim is to enforce remedies that will lead to practical changes, rather than fining those that constantly breach the rules.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>159:T1487,<p>In 2020, many companies have faced unprecedented challenges as a result of the pandemic and the subsequent economic upheaval. However, the corona crisis has also triggered a real boost in digitization and modernization of ERP systems.</p>

<p>Whether you are a developer looking for some insights and a self-orientation in this changing world, or an IT leader determined to re-invent your business models and revamp your processes to not lose touch with the competition, you&rsquo;ll find out in this post in which direction enterprise resource planning systems are developing and the relevant trends in the ERP market in 2021 and beyond. These trends are already taking hold of a wide range of industries and creating big opportunities in the era of digital enterprise.</p>

<p><strong>1. Cloud</strong></p>

<p>Streamlining a business&rsquo;s operations with cloud-based ERP software isn&rsquo;t a recent trend, but it continues to be a game-changer. ERP solutions used to have expensive startup fees and hardware expenses. However, all of that changed with the introduction of cloud computing.</p>

<p>This ensures that businesses don&rsquo;t have issues with expensive maintenance and updates of software. Also, they can choose the modules that they need for a department and save running costs.</p>

<p>Companies now take this one step further by integrating hybrid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.controlerp.com/erp-trends/">ERP solutions</a>. This combines the strengths of on-premise and cloud-based ERPs without their weaknesses. This provides an ERP system that is ideal for businesses that focus on products and assets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. AI</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Artificial intelligence and machine learning are moving from the hypothetical phase to real-world use cases, such as fraud detection in financial services and banking, anomaly detection in business contracts and procurement to reduce costly errors, and in the form of robotic process automation (RPA) to automate routine business processes,&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3605053/top-erp-trends.html">Forrester analyst Liz Herbert</a></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>3. ERP with Real-time Data</strong></p>

<p>There are numerous benefits of real-time data for organizations. Some of these are:</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In-depth insights</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved customer experience</p>

<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Streamline business functions</p>

<p>This is why many businesses are integrating ERP systems into their significant operations. According to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bestessays.com.au/">essay help</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.essayontime.com/">custom papers</a>, ERP systems will aid business data communication across the different departments in an organization. This is because it combines multiple tools that the various departments use.</p>

<p>ERP with real-time data also helps to improve the customer service of the organizations. This is another significant advantage as the customer service department has all the information they need about individual customers.</p>

<p><strong>4. Integration of IoT</strong></p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) and massive data stream are affecting the ERP landscape by presenting new possibilities for workflow automation and opportunities to fuel operational excellence and business growth. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fintechnews.org/top-emerging-iot-trends-business-should-look-for-in-2021/">Fintech News</a>, it is estimated that 35 billion IoT devices will be installed worldwide by 2021 and 75.44 billion by 2025.</p>

<p>Manufacturing, logistics, and transformation industries are the ones that are expected to experience the integration of IoT in their ERP systems the most.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5. Mobile Application</strong></p>

<p>Gone are the days when mobility was a stand-out feature. In today&rsquo;s world, it is the standard. ERP systems must have mobile support as basic functionality, and there are many benefits to this apart from accessing data on-the-go.</p>

<p>The ability to undertake business operations anywhere and at any time is an obvious benefit. So, mobile devices like smartphones and tablets provide both front-end and back-end activities. This helps to boost overall productivity.</p>

<p>It also makes the process of capturing data more convenient and accurate. It enhances communication, thereby reducing the risk of delay in production. These benefits can help to increase efficiency, make decisions quicker, and improve the workflow.</p>

<p><strong>6. Digital Marketing</strong></p>

<p>You can hardly talk about ERP systems without mentioning marketing. The growth of these solutions means that companies have to adopt them in their marketing processes. Without an ERP system, a marketing campaign will lack the relevant metrics that are required.</p>

<p>The rise of social media and its usefulness for digital marketing means that ERP systems now integrate capabilities for social media platforms. This aid post publishing, link gathering, getting analytics, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>15a:T1d55,<p>The evolution of ERP from a specialty app to a business-critical amalgamation of solution has faced daunting difficulties over the years. Basically, ERP has gotten too big, too ungainly, too rigid. There are those who have said that &ldquo;ERP is dead,&rdquo; suggesting its costs, risks and lack of flexibility outweigh its value. It has been compared to a monolith, an immovable object with a business unfriendly mind of its own. Is ERP dead or at least dying? Fortunately for those hundreds of thousands of companies invested in ERP, and at least some of the vendors that supply ERP software, there is a savior, which is, in could be referred to as a &ldquo;modern layered services application platform.&rdquo; We will simply refer to it as a &ldquo;modern platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Problems Caused by Big ERP</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the notion that the monolithic ERP solution is a great thing for organizations carries some glaring flaws, such as:</p>

<p><strong>Hard to Change:</strong> The set of common <a href="https://www.oracle.com/in/erp/what-is-erp/" target="_blank">ERP processes</a>, under the pretense of efficiency and best practice standardization, makes it increasingly difficult for a company to adapt to change. Instead of ERP serving an organization&rsquo;s&nbsp;changing&nbsp;needs, a monolithic ERP often becomes a yoke around the organization&rsquo;s neck, forcing the company to adapt to the ERP. Clearly the other way around &ndash; ERP adapting to the business &ndash; is the preferred approach. The last thing a CEO needs is a mission critical application that impedes the company&rsquo;s progress.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Best of Breed:</strong> All the parts of an ERP are not equally effective. For example, some ERPs excel at inventory management but offer weak capabilities for finance; some provide excellent asset management features but skimp on service management. In those business areas where a company tries to differentiate itself, it may want best-of-breed applications versus a &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; ERP version of the solution. For many companies, this big bland vanilla ERP too often proves that &ldquo;good is not good enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Customization Trap:</strong> To get around the weak areas of an ERP solution, a company will often customize the ERP. While this helps the ERP maintain relevancy initially, customizations cause huge headaches over time. For example, there is the question of who supports the customization? Every time a company wants to upgrade its ERP it has to retest and perhaps redevelop each customization. This tartar buildup becomes so entrenched that some companies give up on upgrading. Foregoing moving to the latest version means that some companies end up with ERP versions that are 10 years old, or older. Often ERP vendors will, understandably, stop supporting very old versions of their software. Sometimes the servers and storage on which the old ERP runs face end-of-life and/or are not performing well and cannot be improved.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Technology Innovations:</strong> Everywhere you look, if you track the field of information technology, there are new emerging technologies. Examples include robots, data lakes, AI,&nbsp;multi-cloud, machine learning, software defined storage, a wide range of innovative analytics, 5G; the list is nearly endless.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Modern Platforms to the Rescue</strong></p>

<p>For those companies barely surviving on old, monolithic ERPs, there is hope, and that entails moving to an ERP that is based on a modern platform. One of the biggest mistakes a company trying to replace that 10-year-old ERP monolith could make is to blindly stick with what is known. &ldquo;We want to stay with our incumbent provider because we know them, they know us, it will be easier.&rdquo; While that argument may have some merit if your incumbent has modernized their ERP on top of a modern layered services application platform, companies that do not make the leap may find themselves, again, in what is sometimes referred to as &ldquo;The Death Cycle of ERP.&rdquo; Why opt for an ERP with a modern platform? Here are some key reasons:</p>

<p><strong>Layered services:</strong> A modern platform abstracts all the services it provides into layers. For example, security is important to everything in the world of software. Such a platform might include security-related services at a low or lowest layer. That means everything that gets built on the platform above that layer inherits all the security services. Old ERPs were often developed in a &ldquo;spaghetti code&rdquo; fashion with many workarounds, including security. <a href="https://erpnews.com/why-does-erp-needs-a-modern-layered-services-platform/" target="_blank">Layered services</a> ensures that, as you go up the stack, you worry about less and less. Need to enhance security? Do so in the underlying modern platform and everything above it benefits. Need to enhance the user experience? Offer those services via the platform and the apps above it can take direct advantage.</p>

<p><strong>Emerging technology adoption: </strong>One of the difficulties many companies face is determining how and when to take advantage of emerging technologies. Sticking to an old ERP certainly inhibits the adoption of newer technologies. ERP built on a modern platform, however, makes technology adoption easier and safer by embedding a proven emerging technology as a service in the platform. The ERP solution, and other solutions built on the platform, are then able to take direct, and safe, advantage of the emerging technology. Want to make some cutting-edge analytics available to all the apps? Embed the analytics technology in the platform.</p>

<p><strong>Low/no code extensions and apps:</strong> With everything layered, the top layer, the app layer, becomes a relatively simple undertaking. For example, customizations can be replaced by apps or extensions built on the platform that are&nbsp;not&nbsp;impacted by upgrades. Using abstraction, such as through RESTful APIs, the platform vastly simplifies the development of extensions and new apps, all built using a &ldquo;low/no code&rdquo; development platform. That means business analysts can sometimes make minor changes or extensions to the ERP to keep it relevant with coding. Slightly more complex change or new apps might only require some simple scripting. Do you need to enhance part of the ERP that is too vanilla for you? Low/no code enables you to do that without locking you into an old ERP version.</p>

<p>ERP lifecycles are notoriously long, often measured in decades. Companies make large investments in ERP and run much of their business on ERP. ERPs are complex, multi-functional solutions. But ERP does not need to be highly resistant to change anymore and does not need to act as a drag on a company&rsquo;s growth.</p>

<p>Modern platforms are cloud-friendly, often based on RESTful APIs, use a layered-service architecture, offer low/no code development to help extend the ERP (and other solutions built on the platform), safely speed up the adoption of emerging technologies, and, most importantly, help keep ERP aligned with the business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If based on a modern platform, the ERP your company uses may very well still be relevant to the business and continuously support business change for the next decade or more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>15b:T1a25,<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sage.com/en-us/">Sage</a>&nbsp;(FTSE: SGE), the market leader in cloud business management solutions, today shared results from its&nbsp;<a href="https://online.sageintacct.com/rsrp-2021-return-to-growth-outlook-report-reg.html">2021 Return to Growth Outlook report</a>&nbsp;&ndash; showing that U.S. businesses are becoming increasingly confident they will return to pre-pandemic revenue levels by the end of 2021. The survey, which polled more than 1000 finance leaders across American small and midsize businesses, also indicates that many intend to keep the new business strategies implemented during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Sage&rsquo;s 2021 Return to Growth Outlook report demonstrates many small and midsize companies are becoming increasingly hopeful that business conditions will improve in the second half of this year. While only one-in-three (30%) finance leaders expect to see revenue reach or exceed pre-pandemic levels by the end of June 2021, 73% expect to achieve this mark by the end of this year. Many businesses (56%) also expect vaccine rollout efforts to positively impact their business by October.</p>

<p>Pandemic significantly accelerates digital transformation efforts</p>

<p>To adapt to the needs created by national lockdowns, more than half (52%) of those surveyed say they accelerated digital transformation plans by three years or more. When asked which areas were prioritized in digitization efforts, accounting/finance (45%) was the most popular, followed by marketing (31%) and customer relationship management (26%).</p>

<p>When looking at what technology proved to be the most valuable over the last year, more than one-quarter (27%) of businesses surveyed said cloud accounting software was a &ldquo;saving grace&rdquo; solution, providing finance teams with complete visibility, remote access to real-time data, improved efficiencies, better decision making, and seamless cash-flow management. Businesses clearly see the value in cloud-based financial software, with nine in ten businesses surveyed using or planning to invest in these systems in 2021.</p>

<p>The confidence shown by many businesses reflects success implementing new policies and strategies over the past year. Just under one-third (32%) of respondents acknowledged trying social media advertising for the first time, while 23% hired employees completely digitally for the first time. Interestingly, over one-quarter (27%) of businesses said they implemented non-traditional HR policies &ndash; such as childcare stipends or flexible work arrangements &ndash; for the first time over the course of the pandemic. In what could reflect a burgeoning trend in U.S. businesses, only 13% of respondents intend to reduce budgets for these policies this year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no surprise the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected small and midsize businesses, along with their employees and customers. As we faced unique challenges at home and work, businesses saw great success implementing new programs, offering flexible work arrangements, and prioritizing commitment to the communities in which they operate,&rdquo; said Nancy Harris, EVP and Managing Director, Sage North America. &ldquo;As the world begins to reopen, it is critical that these key learnings from the last year are not lost, and that organizations continue to leverage creativity and technology to foster stronger relationships with employees, customers, and prospects for continued growth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Additional highlighted findings from the survey report include:</p>

<p>The most significant government support program was the federal government&rsquo;s Payroll Protection Program (PPP), as one-third of businesses surveyed cited the availability of government assistance as a key reason for business survival over the past 12 months.</p>

<p>When asked what government aid would bring the most positive impact over the next year, 52% said increased funding for COVID-19 testing and additional safety measures, followed by 47% noting more employee support &ndash; either in the form of stimulus or increased funding for items such as childcare &ndash; would be most helpful.</p>

<p>Among those surveyed, finance leaders from companies with fewer than 250 employees were not only the most pessimistic about achieving revenue growth over the coming year, but they were also the most likely group to have been forced into either furloughing staff or reducing budget last year.</p>

<p>For those who accelerated their digital transformation efforts, 40% of businesses believe they have become much more connected to their customers during the pandemic. However, this drops to just 11% among companies with fewer than 250 employees &ndash; the sector of respondents least able to invest in digital efforts over the last year.</p>

<p>In fact, 23% of these smallest businesses admit to feeling more disconnected from their customers, compared to only 8% of all respondents.</p>

<p>Despite the economic turndown, 88% of businesses made some sort of charitable donation to their local community, and 49% are planning to further increase these programs next year &ndash; reinforcing their commitment to make charitable giving a priority.</p>

<p>Four in five (79%) businesses anticipate chief financial officers will have more influence on the direction and success of their business in 2021. In fact, respondents expect finance to play a more active role in technology-based decisions (40%) and strategic planning discussions (26%).</p>

<p>Finance professionals also extended their career skillsets significantly last year, as finance teams became a more integral part of all decisions.</p>

<p>Almost half (41%) of finance teams believe they&rsquo;ve improved their technology skills, while many believe they&rsquo;ve improved their management skills (29%) and soft skills (27%).</p>

<p>When it comes to the reopening of workplaces, most businesses recognize the impact that increased employee recognition programs can have on loyalty and performance, with 87% saying that they have no plans to roll back the increased healthcare benefits provided during the pandemic, and 99% intend to maintain the same level of childcare/child-friendly office support.</p>

<p>Only 16% of companies are decreasing budgets for employee food and in office perks throughout the year, showing many are planning for some form of office return.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>15c:T1770,<p><strong>Covid-19 </strong>is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain. It is a contagious disease that spreads from person to person mainly through the respiratory route, that is via coughing, sneezing, talking or breathing. With&nbsp;COVID -19 cases rapidly multiplying in the country, comparisons have been drawn to other respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, flu and seasonal allergies. While most of these have similar symptoms including fever, body aches, chills, and cough, each can be distinguished by its impact on the human body. Certain strains of the&nbsp;coronavirus&nbsp;are quite common and only cause mild symptoms. However, some strains are more severe and can cause complications in certain age groups. Drawing distinctions among these illnesses will help the public implement proper measures when responding to the virus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Covid-19</strong> tends to infect the body by entering healthy cells.

But digital marketing goes beyond the basics of marketing on social media websites and refers to any type of marketing that uses digital channels to target prospective customers. This means using text messaging, emails, and apps to reach a wider audience. Here are a few tips for getting started with digital marketing as a small business.</p>

<p><strong>1. Build a Strong Social Media Presence</strong></p>

<p>As the opportunity for direct face-to-face communication is currently limited, small businesses should take to social media to reach their customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://business.gov.au/online/social-media-for-business#:~:text=Social%20media%20can%20help%20you%20engage%20with%20your%20customers%20and,feedback%20and%20build%20customer%20loyalty">Social media</a> is part of the majority of small businesses&rsquo; marketing plans. Almost all small businesses (88%) invest in social media.&nbsp;Social media has become a functional aspect of many digital marketing strategies for different businesses and generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. Use Email Marketing Campaigns to Connect With Customers</strong></p>

<p>While some may argue that&nbsp;email marketing is outdated, most small businesses still use email&nbsp;to facilitate&nbsp;personal connections with their clients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than half of small businesses (54%) plan to use email marketing as part of their digital marketing strategy.</p>

<p><strong>3. Expand Website Marketing Efforts</strong></p>

<p>Online Visibility&nbsp;is extremely important for businesses in this day and age. If your business doesn&rsquo;t have a website, your presence within your market is essentially nonexistent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Small businesses need look no further than their own <a href="https://www.webhostingsecretrevealed.net/blog/web-design/awesome-platforms-for-building-your-own-website/">web platforms</a> to increase their knowledge of website marketing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4. Start Using Video Marketing</strong></p>

<p>The use of eye-catching videos can help small businesses dominate the digital marketing circuit because videos make the average user spend 88% more time on a website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;over half of consumers&nbsp;wanting to see more video content from brands they support, only about one-third of small businesses (32%) plan to invest more in video marketing this year.</p>

<p><strong>5. Reviews On Products And Services</strong></p>

<p>In case you do not know yet- your customers are your biggest investment. So make sure, they are happy. Happy customers will provide positive reviews which are important for the reputation of your company, online.</p>

<p>On reviews are the biggest aspect by, which customers and clients judge your company.&nbsp;According to a recent study, &ldquo;92% of B2B buyers are more likely to purchase after reading a trusted review&rdquo; (G2 Crowd). However, there will be both positive and negative reviews when a business is operating online. The biggest strategy is to know how to handle them. This can be the deciding factor for the customers when they are looking to hire a service or buy a product.</p>

<p>Thus, it is always a good practice to reply on every review whether good or bad. This would show that you are human. It is more important, for local or small businesses even for local <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/best-digital-marketing-services/">digital marketing services</a> to show that they care for the customers.</p>

<p><strong>A. How to reply to a positive review?</strong></p>

<p>&bull; If you get a positive review, say thank you. It shows the customer that their feedback is important to you and that you care.</p>

<p><strong>B. How to reply to a negative review?</strong></p>

<p>&bull; If it is a negative review, do not just stop at the explanation as to why the experience was bad. Go beyond that, and give the contact number of the concerned person, so that the executive can learn more about the experience. This is a great strategy to change someone&rsquo;s opinion after a not-so-great experience.</p>

<p>Apart from just establishing a bond with the customers, reviews also work well for SEO and the ability to get a better rank for your company or website improves</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>15f:T12a1,<p>Sports nutrition products traditionally have been sold largely on efficacy, with taste often a secondary consideration. While health aspects and cost remain the top purchase drivers for consumers, 41% of sports nutrition shoppers consider flavor to be an important factor, according to a report from Innova Market Insights. The company found millennials are the most likely to include sports nutrition products in a typical grocery basket and are the most adventurous consumer group when it comes to flavor.</p>

<p>Coffee flavors are being used to enhance energizing profiles, according to the report.</p>

<p>Berkeley, Calif.-based Gu Energy Labs, a maker of sports nutrition energy gels, offers an espresso love flavor. The product features 40 mg of caffeine plus essential electrolytes and branched amino acids to help decrease muscle damage.</p>

<p>Caramel macchiato and coffee flavors are featured in&nbsp; Oikos Pro &nbsp;high-protein dairy products from Danone North America,&nbsp; Broomfield, Colo. Packaged in both snackable cup and drinkable bottle formats, the products were designed to support strong muscles and bones. The company in January launched&nbsp; Silk ULTRA, a plant-based beverage geared toward athletes who are incorporating more plant protein into their diets and training regimens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When considering flavor options, the Silk team chose espresso as one of its single-serve format flavors,&rdquo; a spokesperson for Danone said. &ldquo;Silk ULTRA Espresso offers the benefits of high-protein for muscle maintenance and caffeine for energy, offering 100 mg of caffeine per serving. In addition to the caffeine benefit, Silk chose espresso as a key flavor given consumer preference for coffee as a top flavor in single-serve high-protein products.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fruit and citrus flavors also are being used to enhance energy and hydration profiles, according to the report.</p>

<p> <a href="https://www.pepsico.com/">PepsiCo Inc.</a> Purchase, NY, uses the natural energy inherent in sugars found in fruit juice as the basis of its&nbsp; Gatorade Juiced &nbsp;line. Available in mixed berry, apple raspberry and citrus berry punch varieties, the product features the same level of electrolytes as regular Gatorade.</p>

<p>Chicago-based&nbsp; Goodsport &nbsp;harnesses electrolytes, vitamins and carbs from milk to create its flagship sports nutrition beverage, which comes in lemon lime, fruit punch, berry and citrus varieties.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flavor is absolutely critical, as athletes and active people must find the taste appealing and enjoyable in order to consume the product at a level that will support their hydration needs,&rdquo; said Michelle McBride, chief executive officer of GoodSport. &ldquo;We launched with four flavors that research has shown people find most appealing when they are hot and sweaty and in need of hydration &mdash; and which we were able to produce with all-natural ingredients to achieve the desired thirst-quenching and delicious taste.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hybridization is another trend, with protein-rich products becoming more widely available under familiar coffee and dairy brands. In addition to the Oikos Pro and Silk Ultra lines that are geared toward athletes, Danone North America offers ready-to-drink protein-infused coffee under its SToK brand.</p>

<p>Companies also are opting for licensing deals for the use of their flavors and brands by existing sports nutrition specialists. Bodybulding.com, Boise, Idaho, last year introduced Hostess Twinkies and Hostess Chocolate CupCakes&nbsp; flavored protein powders under its Remix Nutrition brand.</p>

<p>Dallas-based Dymatize Enterprises teamed up with Post Holdings for its Cocoa Pebbles and Fruity Pebbles flavored ISO100 protein powder. The collaboration gives consumers &ldquo;the chance to enjoy the unmistakable, classic flavor of Pebbles cereal that they have come to know and love in a different form,&rdquo; said Leah Broeders, head of partnerships and licensing at Post Consumer Brands.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is shaping flavor choices around immunity. Immunity claims in sports nutrition launches increased from 7% to 12% in 2020, supported by flavors like green tea, honey, ginger, citrus fruits and berries, according to the report.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the trend toward comfort foods during the pandemic is driving nostalgic and indulgent flavors. PepsiCo is revamping its Evolve brand of active nutrition products with new double chocolate- and vanilla bean-flavored plant-based nutrition shakes and protein powders. The company also is tapping into the berry flavor trend with a berry medley variety and the coffee flavor trend with a caf&eacute; mocha variety.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>160:Tcc1,<p>Shares of drugmakers involved in the production of COVID-19 vaccines, including Pfizer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PFE.N" target="_blank">(PFE.N)</a>&nbsp;and Moderna&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MRNA.O" target="_blank">(MRNA.O)</a>, fell on Thursday, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden&rsquo;s plan to back intellectual property waivers on vaccines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biden-says-plans-back-wto-waiver-vaccines-2021-05-05/" target="_blank">Biden threw his support</a>&nbsp;behind a World Trade Organization waiver of intellectual property rights on vaccines to increase their availability to poorer nations including India, which is under the grip of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-sees-record-daily-rises-covid-19-infections-deaths-2021-05-06/" target="_blank">a massive second wave of infection</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing such a move could be a lengthy process, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-talks-could-still-take-months-2021-05-06/" target="_blank">all 164 WTO member countries required to arrive at a consent</a>, but it could dent revenue and profit for companies that have invested heavily in the vaccines.</p>

<p>&quot;It could clearly reduce potential revenues some of these firms were expecting to generate from licensing their patents&quot;, said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.</p>

<p>Shares of Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NVAX.O" target="_blank">(NVAX.O)</a>&nbsp;and U.S. shares of BioNTech were all down between 2% and 6% before the bell. BioNTech&#39;s Frankfurt-listed shares fell as much as 19% and were down 13% by 1029 GMT.</p>

<p>Pharma shares lost ground elsewhere too, with Germany&#39;s Curevac&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/5CV.DE" target="_blank">(5CV.DE)</a>, which has sought approval for its COVID-19 vaccine, tumbling as much as 15%.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/shares-china-vaccine-makers-slump-us-waiver-support-2021-05-06/" target="_blank">Shares in Chinese vaccine makers</a>&nbsp;slumped with CanSino Biologics Inc , a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine maker, down 16%. Its Hong Kong shares&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/6185.HK" target="_blank">(6185.HK)</a>&nbsp;dived as much as 22%.</p>

<p>However, shares in London-listed AstraZeneca&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/AZN.L" target="_blank">(AZN.L)</a>&nbsp;were unchanged however. Europe&#39;s index of healthcare stocks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/quote/.SXDP" target="_blank">(.SXDP)</a>&nbsp;was down 0.5%, slightly lagging the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark.</p>

<p>Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said any suggestion that other countries could just manufacture and override patents will likely decrease investor confidence in the business models during a pandemic.</p>

<p>Yee, however, cautioned that manufacturing supplies, raw materials, vials, stoppers, and other key materials are in limited supply for 2021 to matter for the ongoing situation in India and South Africa.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>161:T674,<p>The&nbsp;FCC&nbsp;is re-establishing its Communications Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council (CSRIC), with a primary focus on improving 5G network security. CSRIC VII was disbanded in March. Recent cyberattacks such as the high-profile SolarWinds breach have demonstrated the need for CSRIC to re-establish and continue its crucial work. Jessica Rosenworcel, Acting Chairwoman of the FCC, said: &ldquo;I am committed to working with our federal partners and the private sector to increase the security and resiliency of our nation&rsquo;s communications networks. That is why I am refocusing and revitalising the FCC&rsquo;s Communications, Security, Reliability, and Interoperability Council for the challenges of today and tomorrow.&nbsp; The damage from recent supply chain attacks, like the SolarWinds software breach, demonstrates our need for a coordinated, multifaceted, and strategic approach to protecting our networks from all threats.&rdquo; CSRIC VIII will be established on or before June 30, 2021 and is set to perform its duties for a minimum of two years. The council acts as a federal advisory committee and will provide recommendations to the US telecoms regulator on how to ensure the nation&rsquo;s communications systems are secure and reliable. Rosenworcel will task CSRIC VIII with reviewing software and cloud services vulnerabilities and the development of strategies to mitigate their risks. A chairperson to lead CSRIC VIII is yet to be decided and the FCC is seeking nominations. The regulator is aiming for the eighth incarnation of the council to feature the broadest variety of stakeholders to date.</p>162:Td58,Brands have a profound impact on society and culture.
The movements we champion, the people we promote, and
the campaigns we launch – all influence the perceptions of
humans around the world.
Brand Management belongs to everyone, not just your marketing
team. Brand management is the process of managing your brand
reputation and improving your audience’s perception of your brand
in a way that builds brand awareness, equity, and loyalty.
Your brand is a living, breathing thing, which means it’s constantly
changing. It’s also very susceptible to external factors like news,
trends, and current events. In a world where journalists, influencers,
and social media users (just to mention a few) influence virtually
every narrative, brand management is how you can take control of
your business’s story. It is using your branding and brand assets to
communicate value and build loyal relationships with your followers,
fans, and customers.

Principles of Brand Management Brand Awareness Brand awareness is how familiar the general public and your target audience is with your brand. Brand awareness is important because consumers can’t engage with or purchase products or
services from your brand if they’re not aware of it.

Brand Equity

Brand equity is how consumers value your brand based on their
experiences, perceptions, and associations. (This concept goes hand-
in-hand with brand valuation, which is the commercial value of your
brand as perceived by the market.) Brand equity is important
because a valuable brand can support higher prices and increase
your merit among investors, shareholders, and potential buyers.

Brand Loyalty

Brand loyalty refers to how consistently your customers and
followers engage with and purchase from your brand. While your
marketing can’t necessarily influence this, your customer service
department can — focusing on satisfaction and relationship-building
can bring customers back time and time again.

Brand Recognition

Brand recognition is how well a consumer, ideally in your target
audience, can recognize your brand — through your logo, tagline,
packaging, etc. — without seeing your brand name. This concept
goes hand-in-hand with brand recall, which is the ability to think of
a brand without seeing or hearing any branding prompts. Brand
recognition is important because, by recognizing and recalling your
brand, consumers keep your brand top-of-mind and are more likely
to choose your brand above the competition.

Brand Reputation

Brand reputation refers to how the general public and your target
audience perceive the character, status, and quality of your brand.
Your reputation can be influenced by internal factors (customer
service, product quality, etc.) and external factors (customer reviews,
WOM marketing, news mentions, etc.). Brand reputation is

important because it can be some consumers’ first impression of
your brand.

Brand Name

Your brand name is the primary identity of your company. As your
other brand assets evolve, your brand name likely won’t ever
change. If you haven’t trademarked your brand name, we encourage
you to do so.

Your brand name will also likely be reflected in your website domain
and social media pages. Keeping these names, identities, and handles
consistent will help customers discover and follow your business.163:Td85,<p>Healthcare Chatbots Market is expected to reach $345.3 million by 2026 The global healthcare chatbots market accounted for $116.9 million in 2018 and is expected to reach $345.3 million by 2026, registering a CAGR of 14.5% from 2019 to 2026.

Your.MD</p>164:T13ab,<p>Japanese endoscope manufacturer <strong><a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/">Olympus Corp</a></strong> has experienced a significant shake-up in its leadership, with the resignation of Chief Executive <strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/olympus-says-ceo-steps-down-after-allegations-illegal-drug-purchase-2024-10-28/">Stefan Kaufmann</a></strong> following allegations of illegal drug purchases. This unexpected turn of events has not only raised questions about the company's governance but also led to a notable decline in its stock value.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>CEO's Sudden Departure</strong></h2>
<p>On Monday, Olympus announced that Kaufmann, who took the reins as CEO in April 2023, has been dismissed from his position. The decision came after the company received allegations regarding his involvement in purchasing illegal drugs. Following an internal investigation, Olympus's Board of Directors unanimously concluded that Kaufmann's actions were inconsistent with the company's global code of conduct and core values. Consequently, he was asked to resign, which he did without contesting the board's decision.</p>
<p>Kaufmann, a seasoned executive with over two decades at Olympus, had been appointed to lead the company's efforts in expanding its medical equipment division. His predecessor, <strong><a href="https://www.olympus-global.com/company/profile/officer/yasuo_takeuchi.html?page=company">Yasuo Takeuchi</a></strong>, had successfully navigated Olympus through a challenging period marked by asset sales and restructuring. In light of Kaufmann's departure, Takeuchi will temporarily resume his role as CEO while the board seeks a permanent replacement.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Investigation and Allegations</strong></h2>
<p>The allegations against Kaufmann prompted Olympus to consult with external legal counsel and initiate an investigation into the matter. Although specific details regarding the allegations remain undisclosed, it has been reported that police conducted a search of Kaufmann's residence in June but did not find any illegal substances. The Tokyo metropolitan police have not publicly commented on the investigation or its findings.</p>
<p>In an official statement, Olympus expressed regret over the situation, apologizing to shareholders and stakeholders for the distress caused by the allegations against their CEO. The company emphasized its commitment to maintaining high ethical standards and corporate governance practices.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Market Reaction</strong></h2>
<p>The fallout from Kaufmann's resignation was immediate and severe. Olympus shares plummeted by 6% in morning trading on Monday, marking one of the largest single-day declines for the company in nearly three months. This drop is particularly concerning given that since Kaufmann's appointment as CEO, Olympus stock had already lagged behind broader market trends, rising only 16% compared to a 38% increase in Japan's Nikkei 225 index during the same period.</p>
<p>The market's reaction underscores investor apprehension regarding leadership stability and corporate governance at Olympus. Such concerns are not unfounded; the company has a history of corporate scandals that have affected its reputation and stock performance.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A History of Controversy</strong></h2>
<p>Olympus&rsquo;s troubles with leadership integrity are not new. Thirteen years ago, Michael Woodford became the first foreign CEO of Olympus and was ousted shortly after exposing significant accounting fraud within the company. His attempts to reform corporate practices were met with resistance, leading to his dismissal and subsequent legal battles over control of the company.</p>
<p>Moreover, in 2015, Julie Hamp, an American executive at Toyota Motor Corp, faced arrest in Japan for allegedly importing painkillers illegally. These incidents highlight ongoing challenges within corporate governance structures in Japan, particularly when it comes to foreign executives navigating complex regulatory environments.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>As Olympus navigates this turbulent period, it faces critical decisions about its future leadership and strategic direction. The board's nominating committee will explore various options for a successor to Kaufmann while ensuring that ethical standards remain a priority within the organization.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing leadership issues, Olympus must also focus on regaining investor confidence and stabilizing its stock performance. With its core business heavily reliant on medical technology&mdash;especially endoscopes&mdash;the company is under pressure to maintain its competitive edge while managing public perception following this scandal.</p>
<p>The coming weeks will be crucial for Olympus as it seeks to restore stability and uphold its commitment to ethical practices in a challenging business landscape.</p>165:T11e8,<p><a href="https://www.tesla.com/"><strong>Tesla's </strong></a>&nbsp;recent robotaxi event, highly anticipated by investors and enthusiasts alike, turned out to be a significant letdown. The showcase, which aimed to unveil the company's vision for autonomous vehicles, failed to deliver the concrete details investors were hoping for. Instead, it left many questioning the feasibility of Tesla's ambitious plans and the sustainability of its stock valuation.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Lack of Substance</strong></h2>
<p>During the event held at <strong><a href="https://www.warnerbros-india.com/">Warner Bros. studios</a></strong> in Los Angeles, CEO <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a></strong> introduced the Cybercab and Robovan concepts. While these vehicles featured futuristic designs and impressive technology demonstrations, analysts criticized the presentation for its lack of substantive information regarding production timelines and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/g_nelly44/?hl=en">Garrett Nelson</a></strong>, an analyst at CFRA, expressed his disappointment, likening the experience to "watching a movie with a lot of plot twists and special effects" but ending up "scratching your head" with confusion about the actual content presented.</p>
<p>The absence of critical details left Wall Street wanting more. Analysts noted that there was no mention of a more affordable electric vehicle or updates on Tesla's Full Self Driving (FSD) technology. This lack of clarity has led to concerns about whether Tesla can meet its ambitious growth targets in a rapidly evolving EV market.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Market Reaction</strong></h2>
<p>The immediate aftermath of the event was stark; Tesla's stock plummeted over 7% on Friday, wiping out more than $60 billion from its market valuation. This sharp decline marked a significant reversal from the stock's previous momentum, which had seen shares rise over 70% since Musk began emphasizing AI in April. Before the robotaxi announcement, Tesla's market cap had soared to over $760 billion, dwarfing competitors like General Motors and Ford.</p>
<p>Analysts are now urging investors to reassess Tesla's stock price in light of its current fundamentals. Nelson warned that the recent drop could be just the beginning as Wall Street grapples with an increasing disconnect between Tesla&rsquo;s lofty valuation and its stagnant earnings growth.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Discrepancies in Valuation</strong></h2>
<p>Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein reiterated concerns about Tesla's valuation being disconnected from its fundamentals. He estimated that Tesla&rsquo;s automotive business is worth around $200 billion, implying that nearly $600 billion of its valuation relies on less proven ventures like robotaxis and humanoid robots. This raises questions about how much longer investors can sustain their optimism without tangible results.</p>
<p>The broader context includes increasing competition in the EV market, particularly from established automakers like GM and new entrants from China. As demand for electric vehicles stagnates, Tesla&rsquo;s operating margins have suffered significantly&mdash;dropping from 14.6% two years ago to just 6.3% in Q2.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Future Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>With analysts like Guggenheim&rsquo;s Ron Jewsikow suggesting a fair value around $153 per share, it&rsquo;s clear that investors will need to focus on Tesla&rsquo;s fundamentals moving forward. The upcoming third-quarter earnings report on October 23 will be a crucial test for the company as it seeks to reassure investors about its growth trajectory amid mounting skepticism.</p>
<p>Despite a slight recovery in pre-market trading on Monday, where shares were up about 2%, Tesla faces an uphill battle to regain investor confidence after such a disappointing event. The company must address not only its product pipeline but also its profitability challenges if it hopes to stabilize its stock price in this competitive landscape.</p>
<p>Tesla's robotaxi event has proven to be a pivotal moment for both the company and its investors. The disconnect between high expectations and reality has led to significant market repercussions, prompting analysts to reevaluate their outlooks on Tesla's future growth potential. As competition intensifies and demand fluctuates, stakeholders will be closely monitoring how Tesla navigates these challenges in the months ahead.</p>166:T117d,<p><a href="http://metaguest.ai"><strong>Metaguest.AI</strong></a> Incorporated (CSE: METG) has made a significant move in the hospitality technology sector by appointing <strong><a href="https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/222798/Metaguest-Welcomes-Janelle-Howard-as-CEO-of-Metaguest-USA">Janelle Howard</a></strong> as the new Chief Executive Officer of Metaguest USA, a fully owned subsidiary of the company.

This decision comes at a critical time for Disney as it prepares for a leadership transition following months of speculation over who will succeed the current CEO, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger">Bob Iger</a>, whose term is drawing to a close. Gorman, a seasoned board member who has been with Disney since 2016, is expected to play a crucial role in identifying a leader capable of guiding the company through the evolving media landscape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Uncharted Waters in the Entertainment Industry</strong></p>
<p>Appointing Gorman as the head of the CEO search committee underscores the gravity of this leadership transition. As Disney continues to navigate the challenges posed by a rapidly changing industry&mdash;including the surge of streaming services, shifts in consumer behavior, and the ongoing integration of its expansive portfolio&mdash;the choice of Iger's successor is seen as essential to maintaining the company's position as a global entertainment powerhouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob Iger, whose tenure has been marked by transformative acquisitions such as <a href="https://www.pixar.com/">Pixar</a>, <a href="https://www.marvel.com/">Marvel</a>, <a href="https://www.lucasfilm.com/">Lucasfilm</a>, and 21st Century Fox, returned as CEO in 2022 after a brief retirement. His leadership has significantly shaped Disney&rsquo;s current strategy, making his eventual departure a defining moment for the company. Iger's era saw not only major expansions but also difficult decisions, such as substantial job cuts since 2022, positioning Disney for its next phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Guiding the Search for a Visionary Leader</strong></p>
<p>Gorman&rsquo;s selection to lead this pivotal search is a strategic move, given his extensive background in corporate governance and deep understanding of Disney&rsquo;s operations. As a senior executive at a major financial services firm, Gorman brings valuable experience in managing complex organizations and overseeing strategic transitions. His role will involve close coordination with other board members to identify and evaluate potential candidates, both from within Disney&rsquo;s ranks and from the broader industry.</p>
<p>The search process is expected to be thorough and demanding, with the committee likely considering a wide range of candidates. The goal is to find a leader who can continue Iger&rsquo;s legacy while introducing fresh perspectives to tackle Disney&rsquo;s evolving challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Steering the Company Through a Dynamic Media Environment</strong></p>
<p>The new CEO will inherit a company at a pivotal moment in its history. Disney is facing intense competition in the streaming market, where its flagship service, <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">Disney+</a>, competes with other giants like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a>, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max. The new leader will need to drive growth in this sector while managing Disney&rsquo;s traditional media assets, including ABC, ESPN, and its iconic theme parks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As consumer preferences shift rapidly towards digital and on-demand content, the incoming CEO will face the challenge of keeping Disney at the forefront of entertainment innovation while preserving the company&rsquo;s core brand identity. Ensuring that Disney continues to resonate with audiences worldwide will require a delicate balance of honoring its storied legacy and embracing new technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Maintaining Stability Amidst Global Uncertainties</strong></p>
<p>In addition to strategic leadership, Disney&rsquo;s next CEO will need to address the company&rsquo;s financial and operational challenges. This includes managing the high costs associated with content production and distribution, as well as optimizing the company&rsquo;s extensive global operations. The integration of 21st Century Fox, acquired by Disney in 2019, remains a complex task, with the new CEO expected to streamline operations and maximize the benefits of this merger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The financial health of Disney&rsquo;s theme parks, which have recovered from the pandemic but still face uncertainties due to global economic conditions, will also be a priority. Sustaining profitability in this area while adapting to evolving consumer behaviors will be key to Disney&rsquo;s continued success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Speculations and Timelines for Disney's Leadership Transition</strong></p>
<p>While the official search for Disney&rsquo;s next CEO is now underway, the timeline for an announcement remains uncertain. Industry experts speculate that the board may take several months to make a decision, aiming to ensure the selection of the best candidate to lead Disney into its next chapter.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Bob Iger will continue to helm the company, providing stability as the search committee conducts its work. His leadership during this transitional period will be crucial in maintaining investor confidence and keeping Disney on course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Potential Candidates in the Spotlight Internal Talent vs. External Perspectives</strong></p>
<p>Although no official names have been announced, speculation is rife about who might succeed Iger. Internal candidates like Josh D&rsquo;Amaro, Chairman of Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products, and Dana Walden, Chairman of Disney General Entertainment Content, are believed to be strong contenders. However, the search committee may also consider external candidates with expertise in digital media, technology, or global entertainment, seeking fresh perspectives to guide Disney forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever is chosen, the new CEO will need to embody a deep understanding of Disney&rsquo;s unique culture, a commitment to its creative legacy, and the strategic vision to lead one of the world&rsquo;s most iconic companies into an increasingly digital future.</p>168:T10e3,<p>The economic landscape in the United States is standing on a precipice, with the Federal Reserve's next move holding the key to the nation's financial future. On Sunday, <a href="https://www.bankofamerica.com/">Bank of America</a> CEO <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Moynihan">Brian Moynihan</a> issued a cautionary statement that echoes across the financial world: if the U.S. Federal Reserve does not begin to lower interest rates soon, the consequences could be dire for American consumers. His warning comes as the Fed keeps its policy rate unchanged at the 5.25%-5.50% range, a position it has maintained for over a year, even as it hints at potential rate cuts in the near future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Nation on Edge: The Cost of High Interest Rates</strong></p>
<p>For over a year, American consumers have been grappling with higher borrowing costs as the Fed's interest rate policy has remained steadfast. While the Fed's decision to hold the rate steady at the end of July provided some relief, it has done little to alleviate the underlying concerns among consumers and financial leaders alike. Moynihan, speaking in an interview with CBS, made it clear that the Fed's current stance might be sending the wrong signal to the American public. "They've told people rates probably aren't going to go up, but if they don't start taking them down relatively soon, you could dispirit the American consumer," Moynihan stated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank of America CEO's remarks underscore a critical point: consumer sentiment plays a pivotal role in the health of the U.S. economy. The American consumer, often hailed as the engine of economic growth, is showing signs of strain under the weight of prolonged high-interest rates. Moynihan&rsquo;s warning is not just about the immediate impact of these rates but about the long-term psychological effects on consumers. "Once the American consumer really starts going very negative, then it's hard to get them back," he warned, highlighting the potential for a downward spiral in consumer confidence that could be difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Fed's Independence Under Scrutiny</strong></p>
<p>Moynihan's comments come at a time when the Federal Reserve's independence is being questioned, particularly in the political arena. Former President <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">Donald Trump</a>, a Republican candidate in the upcoming elections, has made headlines with his assertion that presidents should have a say in the Federal Reserve's decisions. This controversial stance has reignited debates about the role of the Fed and its relationship with the government. When pressed on this issue, Moynihan defended the Fed's independence, stating, "If you look around the world's economies and you see where central banks are independent and operate freely, they tend to fare better than the ones that don't."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moynihan&rsquo;s response highlights a broader consensus among financial leaders: the strength of a nation's economy often hinges on the ability of its central bank to operate without political interference. The Fed's independence is seen as a cornerstone of economic stability, and any attempt to undermine this independence could have far-reaching consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Road Ahead: Navigating Economic Uncertainty</strong></p>
<p>As the U.S. Federal Reserve navigates the complex terrain of monetary policy, the stakes have never been higher. The decision to maintain, raise, or cut interest rates will not only impact the immediate economic outlook but could also shape consumer sentiment for years to come. Moynihan's warning serves as a reminder that the American consumer's confidence is fragile, and the Fed's actions in the coming months will be crucial in determining whether that confidence is restored or eroded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve as it weighs its options. Will it take the decisive step of lowering interest rates to support consumer confidence, or will it maintain its current course, risking a potential loss of faith among American consumers? The answer to this question could define the economic trajectory of the United States for the foreseeable future.</p>169:T13d5,<p><a href="https://www.intc.com/">Intel (INTC)</a> delivered a jolt to the market, leaving investors reeling with shock and disbelief. The chip giant's shares plummeted by approximately 25% on Friday morning, following a brutal quarterly earnings report on Thursday. The company's ticker page on Yahoo Finance skyrocketed to the top of the most-visited list, even surpassing tech behemoths <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-stock-tumbles-nearly-10-on-weaker-than-expected-earnings-report-205807105.html">Amazon (AMZN)</a> and Apple (AAPL), both of which had posted better-than-expected quarters.</p>
<h3><strong>Missing the Mark: Sales, Margins, and Earnings Disappointment</strong></h3>
<p>The staggering drop in Intel&rsquo;s stock was driven by a significant miss on multiple fronts. Analysts&rsquo; estimates for sales, gross profit margin, and earnings were all widely missed, as Intel grappled with tougher market conditions and unexpectedly high costs associated with scaling AI chip production. This troubling performance highlighted the struggles Intel faces in adapting to the evolving tech landscape, especially as it tries to keep pace with rivals Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Drastic Measures: Dividend Suspension and Workforce Reduction</strong></span></p>
<p>In response to these challenges, Intel took the drastic step of suspending its dividend, a move set to take effect in the fourth quarter. This marked a significant departure from its history, as Intel had consistently paid dividends for 125 consecutive quarters, totaling $3.1 billion in 2023 alone. Additionally, the company announced a 15% reduction in its workforce, a decision aimed at preserving liquidity. With approximately 125,000 employees as of the end of the second quarter, this cut represents a significant shift in Intel&rsquo;s operational strategy.</p>
<h3><strong>Slashing Capital Expenditures: A Leaner Future</strong></h3>
<p>Intel also announced a 20% cut in its capital expenditure spending for 2024, compared to previous estimates. The capital expenditure for 2025 is projected to be about $5 billion lower than 2024 levels. These reductions underscore the company&rsquo;s efforts to streamline operations and focus resources more efficiently as it navigates a challenging period.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>A Major Restructuring: CEO Pat Gelsinger&rsquo;s Vision</strong></span></p>
<p>"This is the biggest restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor decision four decades ago," Intel CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patgelsinger">Pat Gelsinger</a> stated in a live interview on Yahoo Finance. Despite the disappointing quarter and outlook, Gelsinger expressed his commitment to the long-term transformation of Intel. "This is what I signed up for [when I came in as CEO]," he added, signaling his determination to steer the company through this turbulent phase.</p>
<h3><strong>Facing an Uncertain Future: Challenges in the Semiconductor Industry</strong></h3>
<p>The recent quarter and accompanying commentary have cast fresh doubts on Intel&rsquo;s ability to reclaim its leadership position in an industry increasingly dominated by Nvidia and AMD. The competition is fierce, and Intel&rsquo;s ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial in determining its future success.</p>
<h3><strong>Federal Support: Building for the Future</strong></h3>
<p>Earlier this year, Intel secured significant federal support, winning $8.5 billion in grants and another $11 billion in loans from the Biden administration to build semiconductor plants in four states. These investments are part of Intel&rsquo;s broader strategy to become a leading manufacturer of chips for other companies, directly challenging the current market leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC).</p>
<h3><strong>Wall Street's Skepticism: A Tough Road Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>Wall Street&rsquo;s reaction to Intel&rsquo;s turnaround plan has been notably skeptical. JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur remarked, "This marks the third consecutive quarter of negative revenue reset, and disappointing guidance, which we believe reflects the challenging industry fundamentals combined with company-specific drivers." Sur reiterated his Underweight (Sell equivalent) rating on Intel, highlighting the considerable hurdles the company faces in its quest for recovery.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Intel</strong></h3>
<p>Intel&rsquo;s current situation represents a critical juncture for the company. The aggressive measures taken by CEO Pat Gelsinger indicate a willingness to make bold changes in response to evolving market dynamics. However, the path forward is fraught with challenges, and Intel&rsquo;s ability to navigate these effectively will determine whether it can regain its footing and reestablish itself as a leader in the semiconductor industry. Investors and industry watchers alike will be closely monitoring Intel&rsquo;s progress in the coming quarters.</p>16a:T149a,<p>The stock market faced a sharp downturn on Thursday, driven by mounting worries over U.S. economic growth as August trading commenced. <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/index/comp">The Nasdaq Composite (COMP)</a> experienced a significant drop of 2.2%, marking its worst decline in nearly a week. This decline came in the wake of investor anxiety regarding earnings from mega-cap tech companies. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell by 1.5%, shedding approximately 600 points, with <a href="https://www.boeing.com/">Boeing (BA)</a> leading the decline. The S&amp;P 500 (SP500) also lost 1.6%, reflecting a broader market retreat.</p>
<h3><strong>Economic Data Adds Fuel to the Fire</strong></h3>
<p>The start of August brought with it a slew of economic updates that further exacerbated market concerns. Weekly initial jobless claims increased by 14,000 to 249,000, surpassing the consensus estimate of 236,000. Additionally, the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-factories-growth-output-pmi/article68471829.ece">U.S. PMI Manufacturing Index</a> slipped into contraction territory, registering a reading of 49.6 in July. These indicators pointed to potential weaknesses in the economic landscape, contributing to the market's downward trajectory.</p>
<h3><strong>Fed's Balanced Approach and Rate Cut Speculations</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC)</a> July statement indicated a shift towards a more balanced approach in monitoring its dual mandate of managing inflation and employment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at the possibility of an interest rate cut as early as September. "Powell sounded a bit more confident that policy rates are restrictive and monetary policy lags are starting to show through in the last six months. With the economy no longer overheated, that would provide even more impetus to return the policy rate to a neutral stance," noted Andrew Hollenhorst, chief U.S. economist at Citigroup. Hollenhorst further predicted that the Fed would cut rates in September and continue to do so at subsequent meetings, aiming for a terminal rate of 3.25-3.50% by 2025.</p>
<h3><strong>Bond Market Reaction: A Flight to Safety</strong></h3>
<p>Amidst the turbulence in equity markets, investors sought refuge in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/rising-us-debt-burden-spooks-some-bond-investors-ahead-november-election-2024-05-24/">U.S. government debt</a><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/rising-us-debt-burden-spooks-some-bond-investors-ahead-november-election-2024-05-24/">,</a> driving down the 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) by 5 basis points to 3.98%, dipping below 4% for the first time since February. The 2-year yield (US2Y) also fell by 6 basis points to 4.20%. This shift highlighted a significant move towards safer assets as market participants reacted to the latest economic signals and the Fed's potential policy adjustments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Meta Shines Amidst the Gloom</strong></h3>
<p>While most of the market struggled, Meta (META) emerged as a standout performer. The company's shares rose by 4.5% following stronger-than-expected quarterly results. The parent company of Facebook reported robust Q2 top and bottom lines, projecting Q3 sales in the range of $38.5 billion to $41 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $39.2 billion. This optimistic outlook provided a rare bright spot in an otherwise challenging market environment.</p>
<h3><strong>Tech Giants Awaited: Apple and Amazon</strong></h3>
<p>Investors remained on edge, eagerly awaiting quarterly results from tech behemoths Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), which were scheduled for release after the market closed on Thursday. These reports were anticipated to offer further insights into the health of the technology sector and its impact on overall market sentiment.</p>
<h3><strong>Mixed Signals from the Job Market</strong></h3>
<p>In other economic news, U.S. employers announced 25,885 job cuts in July, marking a 47% decline from the 48,786 cuts reported in June. This reduction suggested a somewhat resilient labor market despite broader economic concerns. Additionally, nonfarm labor productivity saw a 2.3% quarter-over-quarter increase in Q2, surpassing the expected 1.7% rise, indicating some positive momentum in labor efficiency.</p>
<h3><strong>Stock Specific Movements: Moderna and Carvana</strong></h3>
<p>Among individual stocks, <a href="https://www.modernatx.com/">Moderna (MRNA)</a> faced a significant setback, with shares tumbling by 20% after the biotech firm slashed its FY2024 outlook for product sales, citing lower COVID-19 vaccine sales. Conversely, Carvana (CVNA) experienced a 6% climb following its announcement of a quarterly profit of $0.14 per share, marking a notable turnaround for the online auto seller.</p>
<p>In summary, Thursday's market activity underscored the fragile balance between economic data, monetary policy expectations, and corporate performance. As investors navigated these complex dynamics, the focus remained on forthcoming reports and policy decisions that could shape the market's trajectory in the coming months.</p>16b:Ta9e,<p>McDonald's Corporation (MCD.N) has announced that CEO Chris Kempczinski will assume the additional role of chairman of the board following the retirement of Enrique Hernandez. Hernandez, a stalwart presence on McDonald's board for 28 years and serving as non-executive chairman since 2016, will retire effective immediately after the company's 2024 annual shareholders' meeting, the date of which is typically scheduled for May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his illustrious tenure, Hernandez collaborated with eight CEOs, witnessing McDonald's exponential growth as it expanded its restaurant count, penetrating over 100 markets globally. In a strategic move, McDonald's also nominated Mike Hsu, the chairman and CEO of Kimberly-Clark (KMB.N), as an independent director on the board.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors reacted positively to the news, with McDonald's stock surging nearly 2%, building on its 12.5% gain in 2023. These developments unfold amidst McDonald's ambitious plans to open approximately 10,000 new restaurants worldwide by 2027, potentially marking the company's most rapid growth phase to date. Additionally, McDonald's aims to double its sales from its loyalty program to $45 billion and expand its user base to 250 million customers within the same timeframe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, McDonald's faced its first quarterly sales miss in nearly four years in February, attributing the setback to sluggish sales growth in its international business segment, exacerbated by geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Moreover, signs of a slowdown have emerged in McDonald's U.S. business, primarily driven by reduced order sizes and a shift towards more affordable alternatives among low-income consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, McDonald's remains steadfast in its pursuit of growth and innovation, leveraging its global footprint and customer-centric initiatives to navigate the evolving landscape of the fast-food industry. As Kempczinski assumes the dual role of CEO and chairman, McDonald's embarks on a new chapter under his leadership, poised to address market headwinds while capitalizing on emerging opportunities in an ever-changing market environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appointment of Kempczinski as chairman underscores McDonald's confidence in his leadership abilities and strategic vision, signaling continuity and stability at the helm of one of the world's most iconic brands. With a renewed focus on operational excellence, customer engagement, and digital innovation, McDonald's is positioned to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value in the years ahead, reaffirming its status as a global leader in the fast-food industry.</p>16c:Tb26,<h4>Nvidia, a leading tech company, surpassed analysts' expectations in its fourth fiscal quarter earnings report, signaling robust growth and optimism for the future.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Notably, Nvidia's Data Center business, comprising the majority of its revenue, witnessed a remarkable 409% surge to $18.40 billion.

He expressed dissatisfaction with the current handling of the company's financial situation.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In a letter obtained by The Associated Press on Monday, an attorney representing Neumann and Flow Global Holdings revealed that Neumann, along with partners such as Dan Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point, is prepared to submit a detailed proposal to acquire WeWork or its assets.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>However, Third Point clarified that while they have engaged in initial discussions with Flow and Neumann regarding their vision for WeWork, no commitment to participate in any transaction has been made as of yet. This statement was shared with The Financial Times on Tuesday.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WeWork filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, citing concerns over member attrition, financial losses, and the need to downsize its real estate portfolio. This move came after WeWork's valuation plummeted from its peak of $47 billion.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>According to the letter from Neumann's attorney, efforts to obtain essential information from WeWork for a purchase offer have been ongoing since December. However, they have encountered resistance and a lack of cooperation from the company, hindering their ability to explore alternative options beyond the restructuring agreement. This, they argue, undermines the potential value for all stakeholders involved.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In response, a spokesperson for WeWork stated that the company regularly receives expressions of interest from external parties and evaluates them in the best interests of WeWork. They reiterated their commitment to addressing financial challenges and restructuring to ensure the company's long-term viability.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>During bankruptcy proceedings, WeWork's legal representatives have signaled the need for additional liquidity. Notably, the company has withheld rent payments to certain landlords as part of its efforts to renegotiate leases, a move that some landlords argue violates bankruptcy rules.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>WeWork, founded by Neumann and Miguel McKelvey in 2010, initially promised to revolutionize workspace dynamics, experiencing rapid growth and attaining a sky-high valuation. However, the company's operational expenses soared, and it relied heavily on continuous infusions of private investment capital.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>After a failed attempt to go public in 2019, marked by Neumann's departure amid scrutiny over his leadership style and extravagant spending, SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, took majority control of WeWork to stabilize its finances.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>News of Neumann's potential bid to reclaim WeWork was first reported by The New York Times' DealBook on Tuesday. This development signals a potential turning point in the company's tumultuous journey and underscores the ongoing saga surrounding its future direction amidst financial turmoil.</h4>171:T11b8,<h4>Maybe the Tesla bosses who agreed to give Elon Musk a $56 billion paycheck were just feeling generous. Or perhaps, as the judge who canceled the deal suggested, they were really taken by Musk&rsquo;s superstar appeal.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In her decision, Kathaleen McCormick said those who decided to give Musk the biggest pay in corporate history might have been swept up by the talk surrounding one of the world&rsquo;s most famous CEOs. Certainly, Musk and his style of leading are always in the spotlight.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) might have described Musk's leadership style as "charismatic." Weber saw charisma as a particular kind of authority that comes from people attributing extraordinary qualities to one person.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>He said these leaders, whether in politics or industry, seemed to have a special something that sets them apart and allows them to make big changes in ways others can't.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>My research shows that charismatic leadership is making a comeback after not being so popular for the past twenty years.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Charismatic leaders used to be everywhere, especially in big businesses in the West from the late 1970s to the early 2000s. In the US, for example, Lee Iacocca was seen as the savior of Chrysler for making it profitable again after it almost went bankrupt.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Similarly, Jack Welch, as CEO of General Electric, was famous for his management style and cutting costs ruthlessly, which led to amazing growth at the company. In the UK, Richard Branson and Alan Sugar were celebrated as innovative businesspeople who made lots of money.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>But after a series of scandals in the early 2000s, like the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, charismatic leadership became less popular.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>This trend sped up after the global financial crisis in 2008 and as people became more aware of issues like climate change and gender inequality, which called for new, more responsible leadership styles.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>So, the charisma-based way of managing went out of style, replaced by leadership styles like "authentic" (being true to yourself) or "shared" (leadership as a collective effort).</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Ten years ago, the CEOs of the biggest global companies weren&rsquo;t famous household names. But today, bosses of companies like Meta, Amazon, and Tesla are world-famous. So why the change?</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Partly, it happened because after the 2008 financial crisis, tech companies grew rapidly in value, often credited to their founders. Figures like Jeff Bezos and Sam Altman became seen as entrepreneurial heroes, increasing their fame.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Another reason is that we're living in a time of crisis. Some sociologists warned back in 2002 that praising charismatic CEOs as "saviors" distracts us from others' contributions to a company&rsquo;s success.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Charismatic leaders may seem like an easy solution to worries about climate change, war, and economic troubles. When Musk talks about saving humanity by colonizing space, or Sam Bankman-Fried talks about ending world poverty, they present themselves as redemptive figures to more than just their investors and employees.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Also, in a world where algorithms play a big role, business can feel less human. People might want leadership with a human touch.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>But this doesn't mean charismatic leaders will be as dominant as they were in the past. If they're making a comeback, it's on a more crowded stage. They might be popular in some circles, but so are leaders who champion diversity, ethics, or human relationships.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>While charismatic leaders get a lot of attention, many of us might prefer bosses who are less grandiose and more modest in their leadership. That could be someone like Mary Barra at General Motors or Lars Fruergaard J&oslash;rgensen at Novo Nordisk. Or it could be one of the many leaders whose names aren't in the news every day.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As a recent biography of Musk shows, he holds a lot of power through his business interests in social media, satellite technology, and cars. So, maybe the big question is how we can make sure some charismatic leaders don't have too much power. Cutting $56 billion from someone's fortune might be a step in the right direction.</h4>172:T9c3,<h4>On February 4th, leaders from around the world met in Weifang, China, for the fifth Shandong Heavy Industry - <strong>Weichai Power Global CEO</strong> Conference. This gathering brought together 58 top executives from Shandong Heavy Industry Group's operations in 13 countries. The goal was to discuss the future of the conglomerate and strategies for worldwide growth.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong>Tan Xuguang</strong>, the chairman of Shandong Heavy Industry Group and Weichai Power, led the event. He gave a speech called "Earning Respect of Global Customers Through Strength." Mr. Tan looked back on the group's achievements in the last 20 years, highlighting its global expansion and successful collaborations. He expressed a shared dream of creating a world-class corporation and ensuring the well-being of their 150,000 employees worldwide.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The pivotal move in Shandong Heavy Industry Group's global journey was Weichai Power's acquisition of Zhuzhou Torch Spark Plug in 2005. Initially specializing in engine manufacturing, the group expanded into various sectors like commercial vehicles, agriculture machinery, and marine transportation gear. This diversification solidified the group's position as a leading multinational conglomerate in China, with an annual operating revenue of US$72 billion and a global reach index of 48.57%.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Shandong Heavy Industry Group actively promotes open collaboration, expanding its alliance of strategic brands. Some of its portfolio includes Weichai Power, China National Heavy Duty Truck, and Shantui Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. The group also holds significant stakes in global firms like Italy's Ferretti and Germany's KION Group. With innovation centers in over 10 countries, the group delivers products and services to more than 150 countries.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In 2023, the group reported a remarkable 33% year-on-year increase in operating revenue and doubled profits, marking its most successful financial performance to date.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Mr. Tan emphasized the importance of assembling a team of elite CEOs to elevate the organization globally. He urged these leaders to be technologically adept entrepreneurs, visionary thinkers, skilled engineers, persistent performers, and cultural envoys. Their task is to create enhanced value for customers and position the firm as a respected powerhouse in the industrial equipment sector on a global scale.</h4>173:T95e,<h4>Saudi Arabia is undergoing a tremendous transformation, and according to <strong>Walid Abukhaled</strong>, <strong>CEO </strong>of <strong>Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI)</strong>, it's one of the fastest in history. He spoke about this at the World Defense Show 2024, emphasizing that significant changes are happening not just economically, but socially as well.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Abukhaled pointed out that these social changes might not be immediately visible, creating a bit of confusion initially within the defense industry. However, he highlighted the tremendous opportunities this transformation has brought to various sectors. The government's smooth and unexpected changes have paved the way for new possibilities.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>One major aspect of this transformation is the localization of defense spending, as outlined in Vision 2030. Abukhaled stressed the importance of focusing on the domestic market, stating that the Kingdom's market is one of the largest globally. He mentioned that SAMI aims to be among the top 25 defense companies worldwide by 2030, with a clear strategy to achieve this goal.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The CEO also assured that there is now a clear understanding within the industry. When localization is needed, there is an authority to consult, and there's a well-defined industrial conservation plan to facilitate the process. Abukhaled questioned the need to focus on exports when ample opportunities exist within the Kingdom.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Khaled Al-Biyari, assistant minister of Defense Executive Affairs at the Ministry of Defense, highlighted the lesser-explored aspect of Vision 2030&mdash;Saudi Arabia's efforts to modernize its military and security capabilities. The Ministry of Defense&rsquo;s Transformation Program aims to safeguard the Kingdom&rsquo;s interests, including strengthening and modernizing defense capabilities and localizing over 50 percent of military expenditure by 2030.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As the World Defense Show returned to Riyadh in 2024, it showcased over 750 exhibitors from 77 nations, demonstrating the industry&rsquo;s readiness for the future. The event serves as a testament to Saudi Arabia's commitment to its transformative journey, offering opportunities not only for international collaboration but also for the growth of its domestic industries.</h4>174:Tbc9,<h4><em>The young sensation <strong><a title="Carlos Alcaraz" href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/carlos-alcaraz/a0e2/overview">Carlos Alcaraz</a></strong> has left tennis fans worldwide in awe with his outstanding performance at the U.S. Open.

He entered the final day of the <strong><a title="BMW Championship" href="https://bmwchampionship.com/">BMW Championship</a></strong> three shots behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler. However, Hovland's extraordinary front-nine score of 33 and his historic back-nine performance catapulted him to the top of the leaderboard.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This victory marked Hovland's second win of the year on the PGA Tour, following his impressive come-from-behind win at the Memorial. Moreover, this triumph propelled him into second place in the FedEx Cup standings, positioning him as a strong contender heading into the season-ending event in Atlanta.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hovland's Remarkable Round</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hovland's spectacular round of 61 was characterized by precision and consistency. Notably, he hit 12 14 fairways and 16 18 greens and needed just 25 putts to complete his round. On the back nine, he birdied seven out of nine holes, showcasing his ability to handle the pressure of a Sunday round with finesse.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">His only bogey of the day occurred on the 7th hole, where he faced an unfortunate situation off the tee. However, Hovland quickly rebounded and dominated the remainder of the round.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Praise from Peers</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Rory McIlroy, who shot a commendable 66 on the final day, quickly acknowledged Hovland's exceptional performance, stating, "I realized around 14, 15, something pretty special was happening, and he played a great round of golf. He played incredibly."</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scottie Scheffler, one of the third-round co-leaders, also expressed his admiration, saying, "Pretty amazing round of golf to win this tournament like that."</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Record-Breaking Scoring</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hovland's winning score of 263, finishing 17 under par, was a testament to the favorable scoring conditions at Olympia Fields. The early-week rain and a weather delay on Thursday softened the course and allowed players to score lower. Max Homa, who finished tied for fifth, even set the course record with a second-round 62.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The turning point of the tournament came late in the round when Scheffler missed a crucial six-foot birdie putt on the par-3 16th hole. Meanwhile, Hovland's remarkable approach on the 17th hole set up a 9-foot birdie putt that he confidently sank, resulting in a tiebreaker that ultimately favored Hovland.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Implications for the FedEx Cup</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scottie Scheffler, who held the No. 1 spot, will enter the Tour Championship with a two-shot advantage over Hovland and a three-shot lead over McIlroy, who secured third place. Jon Rahm, who started the week as the No. 1 in FedEx Cup points, slipped to fourth.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Hovland's Winning Mindset</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a post-match interview, Hovland attributed his historic round to his ability to trust his instincts and intuition. He emphasized the importance of hitting fairways and capitalizing on opportunities. This mental resilience and exceptional skill allowed him to achieve a remarkable victory.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">"I guess I just didn't try to fight it," Hovland explained. "I just relied on my instincts and intuition, and it worked out this time."</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Viktor Hovland's remarkable journey to victory at the BMW Championship will undoubtedly be remembered as a defining moment in his burgeoning career, solidifying his status as a formidable force in professional golf.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>17a:Tf85,<p>In a strategic move aimed at cost reduction and addressing antitrust scrutiny, Amazon.com is undergoing a significant overhaul of its private clothing brands portfolio, according to a reliable insider source.</p>
<h2><strong>Streamlining for Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p>Initial reports from the Wall Street Journal have unveiled Amazon's intention to streamline its in-house clothing division, with plans to discontinue a substantial 27 out of its 30 private-label clothing brands. This decisive step leaves the company focusing on its core apparel offerings, primarily centered around the brands Amazon Essentials, Amazon Collection, and Amazon Aware.</p>
<h3><strong>A Shift in Focus</strong></h3>
<p>This bold decision is not confined to clothing alone. Amazon is also redirecting its focus by discontinuing its private-label furniture lines. The transition will see the gradual phasing out of two of its renowned furniture brands, Rivet and Stone &amp; Beam, as their existing stock is depleted.</p>
<h3><strong>Customer-Centric Approach</strong></h3>
<p>Matt Taddy, the Vice President of Amazon Private Brands, emphasized the customer-centric nature of this strategic move. "If there are products that aren't resonating with customers, we deprecate those items and look for other opportunities to better meet their needs," Taddy communicated in an email response to Reuters.</p>
<h3><strong>Navigating Regulatory Landscape</strong></h3>
<p>Reports have surfaced that ongoing discussions with the <a title="US Federal Trade Commission" href="https://www.ftc.gov/"><strong>US Federal Trade Commission</strong></a> (FTC) influence Amazon's decision to realign its brand portfolio. The company is reportedly considering this restructuring as a measure to address potential antitrust concerns, preemptively addressing potential legal actions.</p>
<h3><strong>Contextualizing the Regulatory Climate</strong></h3>
<p>The backdrop of this strategic maneuver lies in the regulatory spotlight cast on Amazon by the FTC. Amid growing concerns of antitrust violations within the technology sector, the FTC initiated an investigation into several prominent tech giants, including Amazon during the previous U.S. administration.</p>
<h3><strong>Fairness and Marketplace Dynamics</strong></h3>
<p>Criticism has been directed at Amazon over allegations of preferential treatment towards its own products and a perceived disadvantage for external sellers operating on its platform. These concerns have sparked conversations about fairness and healthy marketplace dynamics.</p>
<h3><strong>Defending Amazon's Position</strong></h3>
<p>Amazon, however, has staunchly refuted any allegations of wrongdoing. The company is preparing to engage in discussions with the FTC in the coming week, where it will present its case against the initiation of an antitrust lawsuit. This move is a part of Amazon's strategic effort to demonstrate that the allegations against the company are unfounded.</p>
<p>Amazon's decision to streamline its private clothing and furniture brands is a strategic response to both economic considerations and regulatory dynamics. By focusing on its core apparel offerings and simplifying its brand portfolio, Amazon aims to enhance customer satisfaction and navigate the complex landscape of antitrust scrutiny. As discussions with the FTC continue, Amazon remains steadfast in its commitment to upholding fairness and transparency in its marketplace interactions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What skills do you believe are essential for strategic planning and business process re-engineering?</strong></p>
<p>BPR can improve the quality of customer service and reduce operational costs. Strategic Planning sharpens the company&rsquo;s vision, mission, values, and high-level aspirations. While Business Process Reengineering (BPR) helps assess your processes and redesign them to fit the new goals of the business, Both skill sets are tightly coupled at the core yet divergent in practice. Leaders who work in strategic planning must be able to analyze and evaluate business plans. They must know market analysis, feasibility analysis, and more. With analytical skills, strategic planners can decide the steps a company needs to take. Business Process Reengineering (BPR) allows companies to redesign their processes by enabling cross-functional teams to work together to determine areas for improvement and ways to optimize maximum value. Many of the critical skills for success are common in strategic planning and BPR, such as communication, problem-solving, critical thinking, change management, and leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you approach enterprise-wide project management? Can you provide us with some insights?</strong></p>
<p>Project management requires teamwork, good communication, coordination, time management, and great project management tools. These keys help achieve the project goal. Effective enterprise program management means setting a clear project plan and using the right tools to monitor progress. The best project managers can manage setbacks while keeping the company&rsquo;s goals and workflow on track. A solid communication plan and the right tools help energize the project team. Equally important are stakeholder identification and an active risk management plan. The foundation for success is leading by example, becoming a role model for the team, positively influencing their work approach, and bolstering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What have been some of the key lessons you have learned from your experience as a business owner, consultant, and educator?</strong></p>
<p>Ask Questions For Which I Have No Answers. This is an essential lesson I learned from the Arbinger Institute, the Creating We Institute, and Target Training International, which significantly improved my leadership and communication styles. For example, by asking questions such as "How do you (we as leaders) guide, direct, and inspire employees to be mindful and aware of what will help our company live into its Vision, Values, and Mission? Or having conversations with employees to enable them to clarify and operationalize the mission? To understand the customer? To satisfy the customer? To work more effectively to enhance the customer&rsquo;s experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you work with CEOs and their leadership teams to enhance their business and leadership acumen?</strong></p>
<p>Projectivity Solutions uses three models for designing client engagements: 1) the Organization Framework, 2) the engagement discovery process, and 3) the Small Business Maturity Sequence. Projectivity Solutions collaboratively serves for-profit and nonprofit organizations with 500 or fewer employees.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Join us as we delve into the remarkable journey of Tony Horwath, exploring his expertise, his passion for process improvement, and his dedication to driving revenue growth.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Tony&rsquo;s Journey Began in the Tech Sector</strong></p>
<p>Tony&rsquo;s professional trajectory commenced with a dedication to the Technology Sector, having earned a degree in Information Systems Management. Fortunately, he was granted the opportunity to begin his career in an IT enterprise that was at the forefront of developing Routing Technology, the precursor to the Internet. Swiftly thereafter, he decided to venture into Business Development within the Technology Sector, with a particular focus on Professional Services. He was at the helm of an IT outsourcing enterprise when Professional Services underwent a shift and a new term emerged - Business Process Outsourcing. This referred to a situation where, in addition to taking over the technology, they would also assume responsibility for the human resources, procedures, and technology.</p>
<p>Tony conceived of a novel solution - Sales BPO. Initially, his focus was on providing sales support to IT companies because such companies are often founded by technologists who are not inherently skilled at sales. His objective was to assist IT companies in expanding their operations by utilizing an outsourced sales team that was devoted to their growth and prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Revolutionizing Business Growth</strong></p>
<p>As an Executive Vice President (EVP) of an Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) company, he conceived the idea of creating the first Sales Outsourcing Company in the United States. His primary objective was to facilitate the growth of technology companies through the acquisition of new clients by utilizing specialized sales teams. However, being a trailblazer in this area was not without its challenges; many companies were unable to grasp the concept of having salespeople representing them while not being their direct employees. During the initial two years of operation, Sales Focus dedicated significant efforts to disseminating awareness about Sales Outsourcing, its nature, workings, and potential to enhance business growth. With a single employee and a vision, he nurtured his brainchild from his dining room, leveraging his expertise and proprietary methodology to help other businesses triumph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pioneering B2B Sales Outsourcing</strong></p>
<p>SFI was a trailblazer in the industry, introducing the first B2B Sales Outsourcing Company to the US market. Their unwavering commitment to assisting companies in boosting revenue and expanding their clientele through devoted sales teams has been a constant focus. Their proficiency in establishing sales teams across all corners of the US within 45 days or fewer enables them to provide prompt and efficient aid to companies. Their proprietary S.O.L.D.&trade; methodology ensures not only their triumph but also that of their clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Transformed Businesses and Built Sales Teams</strong></p>
<p>Despite having started in the Technology Sector, Sales Focus has diversified its portfolio and collaborated with a vast array of clients across diverse industries in the last quarter of a century, serving close to 2,000 entities. Their expertise extends to creating and initiating successful sales teams for mammoth multinational corporations, encompassing over 20 companies listed on the Fortune 500. Furthermore, they have diligently catered to the needs of over 1,000 small and medium-sized businesses and 350 international organizations. Today, SFI works with companies from all industries including Energy, Health Care, Telecommunications, IT, and much more.</p>
<p>Each bespoke program is tailored to the individual client, yet all are crafted and managed through their systematic S.O.L.D.&trade; protocol. Their impressive portfolio boasts numerous triumphs, such as establishing a $30 million business entity for a Fortune 500 enterprise, cultivating an Energy corporation to the extent that it was able to divest for $165 million, representing a Health Care organization on a national scale, and delivering savings exceeding $200 million to its consumers. Moreover, they have guided countless small businesses toward their next level of success. Every entrepreneur aspires to reach new heights, be it their initial $1 million marker, subsequent targets of $5 million, $10 million, $25 million, or even $100 million. This agency has been instrumental in propelling many companies towards these goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sales Strategy with the S.O.L.D.&trade; Process</strong></p>
<p>The S.O.L.D.&trade; process and methodology is a proprietary system that the founder created more than a quarter-century ago. Its approach centers on meticulous preparation before execution. The team devotes 30 to 45 days to the development of the sales strategy before commencing operations. They take charge of all sales processes for their clients in-house. The company employs dedicated recruiters whose focus is on identifying the most suitable personnel, and all employees receive a base salary, comprehensive benefits, and opportunities to earn commissions. Their management and support staff are entirely committed to ensuring quality, oversight, and alignment with clients' goals in developing ideal customer profiles. The firm has a training division with the specific objective of honing the skills of each sales representative, thus enabling them to attain success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SFI's Brand Ambassadors</strong></p>
<p>Each of their sales representatives is meticulously recruited, instructed, and supervised to cater to the unique needs of individual clients. SFI&rsquo;s sales agents are on the payroll of the company, but they function as brand ambassadors for a single client, embodying a genuine sales outsourcing approach. Each sales representative receives specialized training and guidance from SFI&rsquo;s management and operations teams. They meticulously monitor the daily activities and performance of the sales agents to guarantee optimal outcomes for the clients. Moreover, all the data that the agents collect while representing the client is the client&rsquo;s intellectual property and is directly fed into their CRM system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expand Enterprise Sales Globally</strong></p>
<p>SFI possesses the ability to construct and deploy sales teams of varying scales in any international locale within 45 days or less. Their extensive network of partnerships spanning the globe facilitates the operation of enterprise sales teams under their esteemed S.O.L.D.&trade; methodology. Enterprises seeking to broaden their horizons, obtain novel clientele, promptly inaugurate sales teams, or achieve rapid scalability of said teams can all reap the rewards of SFI&rsquo;s invaluable services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unlocking Success with S.O.L.D.&trade;</strong></p>
<p>According to Tony, each and every program undergoes the S.O.L.D.&trade; process and methodology. It is imperative to engage in prior planning and preparation to ensure that they are in line with the objectives of the clients and can effectively achieve them. The development of a sales plan encompasses various elements such as the creation of a targeted Ideal Client Profile (ICP), a value proposition, and a unique selling proposition coupled with differentiation. SFI caters to the requirements of clients who need assistance with all of these components. However, certain clients have a clear understanding of their targets and are focused on client acquisition. They strive to ensure that all clients are sales-oriented, with a compelling value proposition. Their responsibility is to construct and oversee the team to achieve KPIs for activity and performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Health Care Corporation&rsquo;s Sales</strong></p>
<p>Throughout the previous quadrennium, they have diligently represented a prominent health care corporation throughout the expanse of the United States. Commencing the undertaking with a modest 30 sales agents peddling pharmaceuticals, their ranks burgeoned to 60, then 90 agents dispersed across the nation. They meticulously scrutinize their daily activities and channel their efforts towards achieving optimal outcomes for both the client and the end consumer. Each month, they meticulously assess their growth targets and compare their month-on-month progress. With unwavering focus, they have consistently attained an impressive 98% to 105% of their targets each month, even amidst the resounding impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Their unwavering commitment to results is firmly grounded in their strict performance metrics and client expectations, knowing that sales ultimately hinge on achieving monthly targets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sales Outsourcing Experts</strong></p>
<p>The source of their success lies in the achievements of their clientele, as they have enabled the generation of billions of dollars in revenue. They have collaborated with corporations seeking to augment their earning potential, subsequently divesting their businesses. Furthermore, they have erected novel business units for established enterprises and propelled companies from diverse regions worldwide into the U.S. market. Their domain of expertise lies in Sales Outsourcing, and they have established themselves as unrivalled in their craft. Whether the assignment is major or minor, they execute each project with the same scrupulous procedures, assuring triumph. As an enterprise, they have achieved double-digit growth for six consecutive years, and even during the pandemic, they remained unwavering, continuing their expansion into new markets and services. Their principal objective remains unvarying: to aid their clients in flourishing through new customer acquisition and revenue expansion.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is not only committed to his technological pursuits but also to the symbiosis that can be attained by bringing humanity together.

At WiseDV, he persistently advocates for this philosophy, ensuring that each and every one of their innovations, products, and services foster connectivity among all people. </span></p>

His unflinching commitment to bridging humanity has impacted the existence of myriad individuals, nurturing significant links and authorizing individuals to realize their utmost potential.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Unveiling the Trailblazers of Engineering and Aviation</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During his tenure as an engineering scholar at MS University in India, Atul&rsquo;s inquisitive mind was always captivated by the trailblazers who made significant contributions to the domains of engineering and aviation. Atul firmly believed that connecting humanity was the cornerstone of establishing a world that thrived in harmony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1986, Atul embarked on a life-changing journey, relocating to London to explore new frontiers in technology. With an unwavering belief in the possibilities of mobile devices, he set out to revolutionize communication on a global scale. Atul's relentless pursuit of innovation led him to create wireless phones that could be mass-produced and disseminated worldwide, transforming the way people connect and communicate. In 1997, Atul's pioneering spirit reached new heights with the design of the world's foremost handheld digital voice recorder. This groundbreaking device, equipped with an LCD display and flash memory, set the standard for portable audio recording. Eager to showcase the exceptional attributes of his creation, Atul embarked on a remarkable journey at the CeBIT exposition in Hanover, traversing from booth to booth, captivating audiences with his visionary invention. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confident in the preeminence of his Digital Voice Recorder, Atul elucidated its exceptional attributes to Sanyo, a prominent name in the tech industry. Sanyo quickly recognized the superiority of Atul's creation. The esteemed E. Digital Corporation, a San Diego-based establishment that furnished products to Sanyo, extended a cordial invitation for him to venture over to San Diego to spearhead the productization and commercialization of voice recording devices, followed by multi-codec music players. Between the years of 1999 and 2004, he acquainted himself with the entrepreneurship-friendly US tech industry, which proved to be a fascinating experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>From CEO to Visionary</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the successful creation of a voice recognition-based music player and in-flight entertainment system in 2004, he was bestowed with the CEO position at e.Digital. As CEO, his primary objective was to amplify the value of shareholders. During his tenure, he recognized the feasibility of integrating wireless technology with portable video players. Inspired by this realization, he proposed the creation of a wireless Personal Sports Assistant (PSA) designed for sports enthusiasts within stadiums. However, his proposal was met with opposition from the board of directors, which expressed concerns about the potential technological risks. Despite their reservations, Atul remained convinced of his mantra: </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I can develop anything as long as it does not bend the laws of physics." </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at this juncture that he set his sights on a new opportunity to develop without any constraints. His resignation was met with bewilderment from some of his colleagues, who questioned his next move after leaving e.Digital. In response, he presented the WiseDV plan, which was met with several investment offers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embarking on a mission to create a portable wireless mobile TV - LVIS, he sought to provide avid sports enthusiasts with the convenience of watching live games from various camera angles, coupled with options for action replay, slow motion, and access to scores and statistics. In a mere span of 9 months, a prototype of the device was developed, and within the subsequent 9 months, a staggering 3,000 LVIS were produced in Korea and China. American Express sponsored and funded the deployment of these devices at the US Open Tennis and US Open Golf events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the US Open Golf of 2008, scores of sports fans eagerly waited in line for up to three hours to get their hands on the coveted LVIS, and hundreds of them congregated to express gratitude to the creator for enhancing their live event viewing experience - a sight that was truly fulfilling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, these fleeting moments of success were abruptly terminated in October 2008 when the financial market began to crumble, and the fruits of his labor slipped through his grasp. He meticulously analyzed various extraneous factors that had tragically impeded WiseDV's operation in an almost irrecoverable manner. It was time for him to pick himself up and start anew. Going back to the investors was simply not an option. Thus, with a heavy heart, he wound down all operations, including those in San Diego and India, and began from scratch. Throughout this arduous transition, he received heartwarming letters from his laid-off engineers, who expressed their heartfelt gratitude for having been part of an exceptional team that had produced top-notch products. Nonetheless, he remained acutely aware of the undeniable fact that this was indeed a failure that could not be sugar-coated or concealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The mere act of innovation does not suffice. It must endure and persevere. It is imperative to construct a team that can not only innovate but also flourish. He embarked on the mission of cultivating a team with a culture of innovation, collaboration, and honing one another's skills. A team where each member acknowledges the actual originator of any idea or exceptional work rather than claiming it falsely. Furthermore, he stressed the fact that the customer is invariably correct as they propel specific features or functionalities forward. They did not dismiss any feature requests, provided they did not violate the laws of physics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Commencing from ground zero in 2010, they embarked on a quest for potential partners. Atul initiated the journey with Laszlo Zoltan, his broadcast technology supplier. After scrutinizing Atul's pitch deck, Zoltan was impressed by his ambitious plans and products. Nevertheless, he candidly opined that Atul's aspirations were exceedingly grandiose and that investing in his company was a venture that could either lead to his becoming a multimillionaire or his going bankrupt. Despite declining to take the risk, Zoltan was appreciative of Atul's audacity and endeared himself to his mentoring nature. He probed Atul about the products his customers required that other companies and suppliers could not provide. This was the beginning of the development of professional broadcasting products. Lacking an office in San Diego and India, Santosh Patel offered his office in India for their use. Bela Shah, the India coordinator, spearheaded that operation without adequate funding with solo engineer Jigar Mehta. They embarked on the development of an IP-based graphics insertion system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gradually and methodically, they assimilated the needs of the industry and broadened their offerings for the professional broadcasting market. They delved into developing ad insertion products, culminating in the creation of one of Mexico's largest deployments of the Ad Insertion system in 2014. Subsequently, in 2017-18, they developed the WisePlay on-premises and cloud-based broadcast channel playout system to streamline the channel origination process. Survival was not enough for him; he aspired to make a significant breakthrough and shatter the barriers. Communication remained at the forefront of his mind, as he continuously crafted tools to connect with people. When the pandemic struck, his daughter Bhavika, a law student at Berkeley, requested a superior video conferencing solution where participants could move around. The idea resonated with him, and he embarked on developing Bozu in early 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Laszlo's marketing endeavors proved fruitful for broadcasting products, Atul embarked on the creation of a novel video communication platform designed to cater to the younger generation. His sights were set on the vast multi-billion-dollar industry that lay ahead. However, in the early days of 2021, Laszlo, his dear friend, passed away, leaving him shell-shocked and facing yet another test of his mettle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After weighing up his options, he resolved to market the most exceptional broadcasting products and cutting-edge technology under the banner of their brand, WiseDV. With the assistance of a remarkable team, he gradually established WiseDV as a trustworthy, reliable, and robust brand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vassil Lefterov, an accomplished PlayBox innovator, has recently assumed the role of Vice President of Business Development at WiseDV. He expresses his eagerness to collaborate with a company that boasts a remarkable speed in producing cutting-edge products that surpass those of his previous affiliations. In the realm of highly competitive markets, it has established a reputation for reliability. The company's unwavering focus on the customer, emphasis on teamwork and cooperation, and strategic attention to industry trends, customer demands, and technological advancements have all contributed to its prosperity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through the prioritization of client input and the synergistic efforts of the team, WiseDV guarantees that its solutions are not only economically sound but also user-intuitive and customized to fulfill the distinct demands of industry connoisseurs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Broadcasting with WiseDV's Cutting-Edge Suite,</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WiseDV offers a comprehensive product suite that encompasses the entire spectrum of broadcasting solutions, starting from content creation to the seamless delivery of audio and video. Its suite of software and applications are intricately interconnected to enable live streaming, encompassing tasks such as fetching media files, inserting ads and graphics, creating playlists, converting audio and video formats, inserting triggers and markers, and providing OTT middleware/apps, among other things. WisePlay is a playout software that is not only cost-effective but also ideal for originating a TV or OTT channel. It is particularly useful for broadcasters who want to automate and optimize their on-air operations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WiseAdInserter is a tool that simplifies the process of inserting ads, thereby facilitating the monetization of content for the content owners.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Virtual Engineering Team</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The assemblage of virtual engineers and developers guarantees the development, delivery, and configuration of the products with utmost proficiency, while simultaneously providing clients with exceptional support through their adept problem-solving skills. Furthermore, they remain accessible round the clock to cater to customer feedback and furnish solutions. Customers are assured prompt responses to their concerns thanks to their expeditious responsiveness. WiseDV boasts engineering teams stationed in California and India, thereby assuring that any customer, irrespective of their location, will have their queries addressed within moments and solutions delivered within 24 hours. They function as a cohesive unit of innovators and troubleshooters, supporting each other in resolving any issues that may arise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Multi-tasking Professionals</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the advent of the pandemic, a multitude of impediments emerged, impeding the ability of developers, clients, stakeholders, and partners to converge due to their disparate locations and the demands of familial and vocational obligations. WiseDV astutely recognized this as an opportunity to discern the necessity for a virtual workspace that facilitates optimal efficiency while preserving the essence of interpersonal engagement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bhavika, Atul&rsquo;s daughter, was unwilling to accept the limitations of the popular video conferencing solution. Consequently, they created Bozu, a solution tailor-made for the multi-tasking generation, guaranteeing fatigue-free meetings. Bozu enables individuals to work, play, and socialize with multiple groups simultaneously, all in real-time. True innovation transpires when effective communication is established between teams and clients concurrently. Although videoconferencing has been in existence for quite some time now, it has lacked the realistic experience required for the virtual workplace. With the ongoing trend towards remote work, Bozu has fulfilled these demands, and it has proven to be a valuable asset for WiseDV. Utilizing Bozu, its product development has accelerated significantly, even with remote work being the norm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Comprehensive Socialization Experience</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bozu has cutting-edge features as a visual coaction tool that enables proficient individuals to transcend remote isolation and elevate their team's efforts to unprecedented levels of achievement. WiseDV recognizes that work is not exclusively limited to deliberations, but encompasses social interaction as well, thereby highlighting the importance of a comprehensive approach to collaboration.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bozu enables a paradigm shift in remote collaboration through its revolutionary platform. Bozu offers corporate entities an all-encompassing socialization experience comprising integrated Trivia, Karaoke, Whiteboard, Annotated Board, Polls, Conferences, Webinars, Watch Parties, Live Streaming, Game Streaming, and Indexed Sports Highlights, which promote both professional and social cohesion.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Empowering Virtuous Individuals</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WiseDV's advanced ethos strongly advocates for Human Team Intelligence (HTI) as a means to achieve success. Although there are several apprehensions regarding the negative repercussions of AI technologies, WiseDV holds the opinion that OpenAI-driven technologies should be accessible to as many individuals as possible, with minimal hassle and at a reasonable cost. This is because the world faces numerous problems that require solutions, including but not limited to education, healthcare, space exploration, and comprehending climate changes. He opines that the world is filled with more good individuals than bad ones. By empowering more virtuous people with AI technologies, led by value-driven teamwork, they can generate gratifying, awe-inspiring, and life-enhancing outcomes. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">WiseDV, as a cohesive unit, endeavors to maintain a competitive edge by utilizing advanced technologies to develop superior products. To illustrate, it employs open-AI-based metadata insertion technology, AI-based closed captions, and AI-based ad detection in its playout software. Additionally, WiseDV enables AI-based automated sports highlights watch parties in Bozu. Moreover, its adaptability is a vital contributor to its accomplishments. The company always remains prepared to alter its strategies and conform to shifting market trends. By closely monitoring emerging technologies and trends, it remains ahead of the curve and provides cutting-edge products and solutions to its clients.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Human-centric Marketing</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past couple of years, it has showcased its innovative products at various exhibitions, such as Enterprise Connect, the National Association of Broadcasters, and the International Broadcasting Convention. These exhibitions proved fruitful as they garnered positive feedback and high demand for their cutting-edge streaming and video conferencing products. Presently, they have just commenced their marketing endeavors for Bozu and plan to continue doing so, knowing that the laws of physics may not apply to marketing but the principles of human connections hold true. For WiseDV, fostering and maintaining human relationships is ingrained in their DNA, hence their belief in the efficacy of their human-centric and realistic marketing techniques. Although the company has received a few accolades, they are aware that they have a long road ahead of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The WiseDV team shall endeavor to establish further connections by consistently engaging in communication and fostering a familial bond amongst themselves in 2023 and beyond. Their strategy entails collaborating with corporations and associations that share similar aspirations in order to transform Bozu into the quintessential video conferencing and virtual meeting platform, providing an authentic experience.

<h2><strong>Industry Leaders and Satisfied Clients</strong></h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;My background is in playout automation. I have been in this industry for 20 years through my company, PlayBox, which I created in Europe, specifically Bulgaria, where we have served 19,000 clients. Throughout my career, I have always strived to provide forward-thinking technologies to my clients. When I discovered WiseDV, I was amazed at how well-designed the architecture, software, and platform were. It addressed all the unsolved problems I had encountered with previous technologies, and I immediately fell in love with it. That's when I decided to join WiseDV and work for Atul Anandpura, the CEO.&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">✔</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Recently, WiseDV&rsquo;s WisePlay Playout received the Product of the Year award at NAB Show 2023.</span></p>182:T2328,<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profound industry knowledge, strong network in Deck Machinery, and a ferocious determination to succeed &ndash; These are the qualities that enabled Joseph Rajkumar to manage and grow North Pacific Crane Company (NPCC), a global crane manufacturer. Through the work of Joseph and previous owners, NPCC has produced over 2,275 cranes to date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While today&rsquo;s<span style="color: #3598db;"><strong> <a style="color: #3598db;" href="https://northpacificcrane.com/">NPCC</a> </strong></span>is winning contracts and recognition worldwide, Joseph&rsquo;s career had a humble beginning: After graduating from the University of Mysore, India with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering, he started working as an apprentice at Hindustan Machine Tools. Joseph was hired by a few companies, before his nine-year stint at drilling rig company Ingersoll Rand in India.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was when Joseph&rsquo;s wife, Dr. Nirmala Rajkumar encouraged him to try for a job in Singapore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Uncovering opportunities in Singapore</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph&rsquo;s initial visit to Singapore was uneventful. Compounded by visa issues, he had to shuttle between Singapore and Malaysia. Despite that, Joseph managed to return to Singapore, and landed a job through his ex-boss&rsquo;s recommendation. While the salary was not reflective of Joseph&rsquo;s work experience, he decided to bite the bullet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph&rsquo;s first stint in Singapore started in October 1990, and his family joined him there three months later.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Making a name in the crane business</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next 8 years, Joseph was employed by a number of companies. He also became the regional sales manager for Singapore-based Plimsoll Corporation, an engineering firm specialising in cranes and winches.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plimsoll&rsquo;s first entry into India started with Magdala Shipyard. Joseph&rsquo;s sincerity and dedication won the favour of its owner, who started giving him big orders. This paved the way for Plimsoll&rsquo;s success amongst shipyards around India.A similar story unfolded in Malaysia Shipyard. Joseph&rsquo;s </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">technical knowhow and persuasiveness finally opened doors for Plimsoll, and big orders for winches came in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to his exceptional work as a sales manager, Joseph soon became Plimsoll&rsquo;s ASEAN Regional Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His meteoric rise and exceptional sales numbers caught the attention of an American crane company. The crane owners flew to Singapore to meet Joseph, and he was given an attractive offer to work in the US.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing how comfortable his family was in Singapore, Joseph dreaded the thought of having to relocate everyone, but his wife encouraged him to take a leap of faith and accept the job in the US.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Building North American Crane company from the ground up</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a year in the US, Joseph was recruited by the North American Crane Company (NAC) as an international sales manager. Before Joseph&rsquo;s involvement, overseas sales only accounted for 5% of NAC&rsquo;s total sales. But under Joseph&rsquo;s care, NAC&rsquo;s overseas sales rose to 45% within a span of three years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joseph&rsquo;s stellar performance won the favour of his boss, who helped to obtain Permanent Residence for Joseph and his family in the US in December 2003.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite its initial successes, NAC went bankrupt in January 2004. Joseph received job offers from many competitors, but his wife had a better idea. Over the course of several evenings and weekends, Joseph, his wife and their second son Vish worked together to create a new branding for NAC. In 2004, Joseph and his wife, Dr. Nirmala Rajkumar, formed the North Pacific Crane Company LLC (NPCC) in Seattle, WA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scott Mathany, Joseph&rsquo;s ex-colleague, then stepped in to buy over NAC from the bank. Together, Scott and Joseph would spearhead the business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manufacturing, fabrication and crane assembly was to be overseen by both Joseph and Scott under the Carson Hydraulics Company, owned by Scott Mathany. Joseph was to manage design, marketing, sales and servicing under NPCC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get NAC up and running again, Joseph had to sell his first crane from NPCC. He reconnected with the boss of Singapore-based company Zicom, and convinced him to make the purchase. With the money that was generated, Joseph re-hired NAC&rsquo;s veteran design engineer Glenn Adams to head the design team. One of Joseph&rsquo;s former bosses, Edward Higuera, also joined to head the parts and servicing department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vish when he was 13 years old was able to enchane </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPCC&rsquo;s sales drawings, working late hours after school, and on weekends. Joseph&rsquo;s elder son, a computer engineer from UW, also lent a hand by managing NPCC&rsquo;s IT systems, and fine-tuning the company website so it could bring in more sales.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Finding global success with North Pacific Crane Company</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2007, Scott Mathany requested for NPCC to buy over all his crane designs and copyrights. Using the revenue generated over the past 3 years, and the owners&rsquo; personal savings, NPCC acquired the rights to NAC&rsquo;s designs and intellectual property, owned by Scott Mathany.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vish, now with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Washington, joined the Sales &amp; Marketing department of NPCC. He was able to build great rapport, and received the support of an excellent team of design engineers and service personnel. By establishing good client relationships, and taking care of their warranty claims, Vish and team made it easy for NPCC to get repeat customers and orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, Joseph and his wife, Dr. Nirmala Rajkumar, started the Asia Pacific Crane Company Pte Ltd (APCC) to better serve their clients in the Asia Pacific, South Asia and Middle East regions. Cranes manufactured in NPCC (USA) are sold, installed, repaired and serviced by APCC in Singapore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2013, NPCC achieved a new milestone as it bought over the manufacturing company building, along with all the machinery. Today, NPCC has an experienced team of engineers in Seattle, and an advanced one-stop crane manufacturing and refurbishing shop in Carson, Washington, USA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has amassed an extensive clientele over the years, including the US Navy, US Coast Guard, Edison Chouest Offshore, and Alyeska Pipeline Service Company. NPCC&rsquo;s cranes are also well-received in the Middle East, with notable clients such as Zakher Marine International, Al Mutawa Marine Works and Halul Offshore, to name a few.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">NPCC&rsquo;s success cannot be attributed to one factor alone. It is the dedication of its employees, synergy of the management, Joseph&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to excellence, and constant support from his family, that brought NPCC to where it is today.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond the outstanding sales figures, Joseph is also proud of the fact that a number of employees have stayed on with NPCC long term. These include Edward Higuera, Scott Mathany, Joshua Roy, Rajesh Kaduvegere, Gareth Thompson, Benicio Ermita, Kyle Ostergaurd, Dan Morris, Kevin Peppers, Vamshi Goli, Derek Mathany, Nikole Young and Sheridan Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With NPCC&rsquo;s superior teamwork, the company has racked up several loyal repeat customers, and is constantly adding new clients to its customer base. Even with its great track record, NPCC&rsquo;s journey is far from over. As Managing Director of NPCC, Joseph is determined to continue the legacy, and help more clients around the world to buy NPCC cranes.</span></p>183:T275a,<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CGS (Computer Generated Solutions) is a global technology company that has been driving breakthrough performance for nearly four decades.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a long time, cannabis and its medicinal properties have been a debatable topic. However, in the past few years, the perception of it has significantly changed with various researchers discovering its beneficial properties for the greater good. Moreover, with time, several countries are opening up to the importance of cannabis and despite the regulations, the industry has significantly grown at a larger pace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a conversation with </span><strong>Courtney Forgues (President at Portal42)</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we learned how Portal42 is leveraging various opportunities in the industry in order to scale efficiency as well as success. Following are the snippets from the intriguing conversation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Please walk us through the establishment history of Portal42.&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Located in Michigan and Colorado, the journey of Portal42 began in Detroit in 2015 several years before Michigan began to formalize licensing. Initially, our neighbor opened a provisioning center on the east side of Detroit. We were drawn to being a part of what cannabis would inevitably become, so we offered our services at his facility. Though we did not know what we were getting into, it has been a thrilling and amazing experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>How did the company overcome challenges during its initial phase of establishment to become one of the fastest-growing companies?</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early experience in the industry is always beneficial, it provides an upper hand over all situations and also over the competitors. A similar instance occurred with Portal42, where the company gained first-hand insights into the operation of a dispensary from the user&rsquo;s point of view. Meanwhile, it also began to analyze the collected data to develop informed business decisions. The industry was primarily underserviced at that time because of the lack of legislation and fears of experiencing &lsquo;loss by law enforcement.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, soon we started to build a reputation for being a true partner with its facilities. It was one of the first to provide a simple cloud-based system to use and helped them plan their next moves. We love to see our customers grow along with it and eventually we became the largest point-of-sale provider in the state, with one in every two facilities using our services. The company kept its approach simple, it dedicated itself to being the leader in Michigan and focused on building relationships locally while being a resource to everyone it encountered in the industry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>How did Portal42 pave its path through the underlying and existing regulations related to Cannabis in order to successfully cater to its customers and prospects?</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although we were quite early in the journey, the team of Portal42 understood the relationship between the company and customers. Another advantage that helped the company to grow successfully since its inception was its vision. The Port42 team realized that leveraging simple portal software can bring a revolutionary change in the industry. With a nod to 420 and a tip of the cap to Douglas Adams, the company assigned a name for that destination, and Portal42 was born. It also adopted the &lsquo;answer to life, the universe, and everything approach to its customers and internally implemented the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Panic&rsquo; creed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Please walk us through the array of offerings provided by Portal42. How is the company resolving the existing issues and challenges in the marketsphere?</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than the visionary approach in the industry, Portal42 has an in-store option that reports to the state in real-time and a delivery &amp; pickup option with online payments is a powerful separating factor in the industry. The company is much more than just a point of sale. It offers numerous services that differentiate it from its competitors in the industry. It helps eliminate the need for additional fees for services like online ordering, delivery, marketing to your customers, and taking payments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portal42 comprehended the need to seize the factors which might interrupt the facilities from reaching a wider audience. From internet outages to hardware failures to seizures, their business could be interrupted at any time and for any length of time. We decided to work for our facilities to develop solutions for many of the problems that faced that threatened to stall their businesses. We began offering hardware and networking services to ensure their entire facility&rsquo;s technology was running as efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>What is the primary mission of Portal42?&nbsp;</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Portal42 believes in the motto of listening to its customers&rsquo; needs. This motto has been and will continue to be to its advantage as the company respects its relationships with the facilities and their immediate needs. We are not simply a &ldquo;POS Solution&rdquo; but rather, we partner with our facilities and spend the time necessary to learn their particular needs and focus intently on delivering those opportunities to ensure that they will maximize their potential when it comes to the vision they have for their single facility or their entire brand and its reach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Please walk us through the team of Portal42. Being at the helm, what are your primary roles and responsibilities as a leader?</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a phenomenal team who understand the industry and where it is at this particular moment. Our approach has always been to inform them of our vision for upcoming opportunities based on where the industry is changing. As the company progresses into the future the roles will get more and more focused on the landscape of the entire industry and how it can help the facilities to be their most effective in the ever-changing landscape.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Lastly, how do you envision the future of the Cannabis industry? Do you anticipate any upcoming opportunities that Portal42 can leverage for scaling success?</em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cannabis industry may have significantly grown but there are still a few loose ends to be mended. Courtney anticipates that even with the acceptance of payments and eventual legalization there will be several challenges to overcome. Once it is legalized nationally, there will most likely be some sort of blanket laws that could potentially shake up some of the current state-based regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digitalization is taking over the industry and soon banking will become mainstream and the population might turn to cashless transactions. The aim of Portal42 will be to help the industry incline more towards the cloud and in doing so revolutionized the landscape of cannabis.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Whether you have a large cannabis facility or are just starting out, our pricing is modeled to ensure you can enjoy every feature we offer without having to sacrifice a quality experience for your patients.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Moving Cloud from Traditional On-Premise Applications</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Established in 2009, the idea behind founding FinancialForce was driven by the technology move to the cloud from traditional on-premise applications which further instigated the desire to rebuild a new ERP solution on a cloud platform. After a thorough look at the technology platforms, the team chose Salesforce as they were about to launch force.com and were a great partner in the early days, and remain so today. Moreover, they had a loyal ecosystem they had built up where there was a lot of desire to connect the front office and back office applications on a single platform. As a result, the founders decided to spin the company out of Unit4 in order to drive success around the new cloud product which had a different development and sales methodology, as well as marketing philosophy, to a traditional on-premise business, thus leading to the birth of FinancialForce.</p>
<p>Currently, FinancialForce elevates business growth with customer-centric ERP Cloud, PS Cloud, and CS Cloud solutions. Run on the leading cloud platform, Salesforce, these solutions enable organizations to run a connected services business, deliver with intelligence, and achieve agility and resilience, even in times of uncertainty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Plethora of In-Demand Offerings</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FinancialForce offers a broad Services-as-a-Business platform, which encompasses the core processes of services businesses, ranging from estimating and sales, through delivery and billing, extending into customer support and success, and circling back to renewals and expansion. The company&rsquo;s PS Cloud product is widely considered the top product in its space, a position supported by 15 straight quarters as the overall leader among reviews found on G2. Thus, the offering stands out for its robust features; its close alignment to Salesforce; and its tight coupling with Finance and Customer Success offerings, which empower customers to build full end-to-end business systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Adherence to Core Values</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FinancialForce operates in adherence to the following core values:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Relentlessly Innovate</strong>: The company is intensely curious and delivers cutting-edge innovation.</li>
<li><strong>Champion Each Other</strong>: FinancialForce fosters a community of belonging that values differences, recognizes and rewards support and collaboration, and celebrates achievement.</li>
</ul>
<p>FinancialForce places tremendous value and emphasis on employee happiness and satisfaction. The company has built a culture that resonates with its employees and supports them in numerous ways. At times when many companies are struggling to avoid employee burnout and counter the trends of &ldquo;quiet quitting&rdquo; and the Great Resignation, FinancialForce has worked hard to create an environment where employees are empowered to advocate for their needs and achieve their career goals.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;FinancialForce is the top choice for professional services organizations because solutions help these organizations run their services as a business.

<h2>Delivering Excellence Across Entire Customer Journey</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By providing a complete, unified platform, FinancialForce is able to help businesses deliver Services-as-a-Business (SaaB), which is focused on delivering excellence across the entire customer journey. Without a unified platform that aligns with PS Cloud, ERP, and CS Cloud, services businesses lack a comprehensive view of their business. They may be unable to deliver on customer outcomes and as a result, they may operate at a financial loss or struggle to break even. With a SaaB platform, services businesses are able to accelerate growth by having the tools they need to successfully deliver high-quality services on time, on budget, and meet or exceed customer expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owing to its plethora of in-demand offerings, FinancialForce has garnered several accolades and significant recognition in the industry. Some of its key achievements include being named the #1 most adopted Professional Services Automation Solution in the 15th annual PS Maturity&trade; Benchmark published by SPI Research, earning the top spot on G2&rsquo;s 2022 Best Software Awards for Accounting and Finance Products, and being recognized as a &ldquo;Core Provider&rdquo; in the 2021 Nucleus Research ERP Technology Value Matrix.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headquartered in Baton Rouge, LA, the company was founded in 2001 with the intention to create innovative technology while simultaneously providing information technology management and end-user support. General Informatics is a leading provider of Managed IT services (MSP) to over 600 customers spread from the Carolinas to Colorado with a mission to solve business challenges through the best use of technology. The company operates as the IT department mainly for customers in several prominent sectors such as Public Sector, Healthcare, Professional Services, Construction, Banking and Manufacturing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vast Offerings by Expert Leadership Team</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since its inception, General Informatics has built a comprehensive offering, including end-to-end MSP services, and is staffed with an experienced leadership team. Today, the company is known and well-recognized for delivering high-quality services. In fact, it has especially a reputation as a leading IT partner of businesses, schools, and government agencies owing to its holistic services and offerings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Owing to its comprehensive solutions and services, General Informatics has earned various accolades for delivering a high level of service, a 98% revenue retention rate, and a productive partnership with Microsoft. In fact, the company was named &lsquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">#1 Technology Solution&rsquo;</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country by Microsoft Corporation. Additionally, General Informatics ranks among the world&rsquo;s Top 100 Vertical Market MSPs for 2022, according to ChannelE2E. The company was recognized on CRN&rsquo;s 2022 MSP 500 List, and named six times to the list of the fastest-growing companies in America by Inc. 500. Further in 2022, it received the distinction of &lsquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Managed Security Services Company</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; by CyberSecurity Review.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Simplifying Complex Cybersecurity Landscape</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Speaking of its most popular offering, General Informatics vCIO and vCISO services continue to gain momentum as the importance of prioritizing technology and cyber security within an organization become more pertinent. The complex and ever-changing cyber security landscape requires a certain level of expertise that most organizations do not have the time or resources to navigate. Besides, hiring an in-house CIO or CISO is not affordable for most small to medium-sized organizations. Thus, by contracting out a vCIO and/or vCISO, more businesses are able to access the technology and security guidance needed for their organization without having to face the burden of seeking the talent pool and significantly adjusting their budget.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&ldquo;Investing in Our People&rdquo; Approach</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GI boasts multiple technical teams, each comprised of conscientious technicians and engineers, experienced in a myriad of technical competencies, and arranged with subject matter experts to remain agile and allow quick incident response and remediation. The company&rsquo;s support teams understand that downtime for the clients means lost productivity and revenue. Its support structure enables it to serve the clients irrespective of the scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With its comprehensive offerings, General Informatics inspires others to solve business challenges through the best use of technology. When the company is hired by an organization, it undertakes the role of a vendor. Moreover, it acts like a partner dedicated to the success of the organization through the best use of technology. The company firmly believes that the greatest investment toward supporting the customers is investing in &ldquo;our people&rdquo;. As a result, it assigns each client to a dedicated technical team.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vast Array of Clientele Portfolio</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Informatics clientele consists of government agencies, healthcare, non-profits, professional services, financial institutions, and the maritime industry. The company has been strategic in its growth plans to expand its geographic reach with managed services providers that are well established in different verticals but are aligned with General Informatics&rsquo; culture and values. As a result, the approach has allowed for seamless organizational integration with the advantage of specializing in a vast number of industries. The entire process is a part of GI&rsquo;s framework and is typically a key initiative each year. The company takes the following three things into consideration and by doing so, it affirms that it can usher in innovation to its current and new products as well as its product and services portfolio.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Voice of the Customer</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Here, GI considers customers&rsquo; feedback on its current products and services as well as its strategies to innovate and create new products.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Voice of the Industry:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The company considers the recent happenings in and around the industry that could impact the viability and economics of those products and services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Voice of the Team</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: GI understands how its internal team believes that customers are the highest and best value for the company</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customers at the Center of the Equation</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Informatics puts the customer at the center of the equation. As a managed service provider, it stays updated on its customers&rsquo; needs and ensures being aware of issues and fixing them before they are even aware of the problem. Its service delivery model is tailored to the specific needs and goals of each customer. When a customer signs on with General Informatics, they have a dedicated customer success manager and service team for their account to ensure the company&rsquo;s services are helping serve their business goals. In simple words, the company wants its customers to be able to take IT for granted and hence, &ldquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Complex IT Made Simple</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ushering Innovation into Offerings</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General Informatics is continuously ushering innovation into its products and services. In 2021, the company brought advanced email monitoring within its Fortress365 Suite and as well rolled out Surveillance As-A-Service. In the upcoming months, the company plans to continue bringing new solutions to the table. For instance, it is currently working on a new EDR offering that increases the protection of the end-user devices on the network; as well as offering a more advanced methodology of security scanning on those devices and the entire network. In addition to upcoming offerings, General Informatics is envisioning expanding its geographic reach and planning to grow into at least 5 new geographies in the next 24 months.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>At the Forefront:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Donald Monistere</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the </span><strong>CEO </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><strong>President </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of General Informatics who joined the team in 2020 and has been actively contributing to its growth ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monistere has been a well-known executive for many years in the Information Technology industry. With over 30 years working in technology, he endorses an extensive career portfolio. In fact, he has served in top leadership positions throughout his career for various renowned organizations before joining the team GI. Moreover, he is the author of &lsquo;Enhanced Life Performance and Enhanced Executive Performance&rsquo;. Currently, Monistere is in the process of releasing his third book of the series, Enhanced Corporate Performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;From the beginning, we have maintained our commitment to meeting the growing needs of our clients through continuous innovation.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><a href="../../../magazine/20-Fastest-Growing-Companies-to-Watch-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read Full Iussue Here</a></strong></p>187:T4b50,<p>Disabled individuals who want to drive face challenges not typically experienced by other drivers. While most people can get into their vehicles relatively quickly and start driving, the disabled first must spend up to fifteen minutes using multiple remote controls to open doors, operate lifts, and raise seats. This process gets repeated multiple times each day and further becomes more complicated in cases where a remote control fails to operate. As one would expect, disabled drivers generally spend more time in the heat, rain, and cold than other drivers as they wait for their vehicles to be ready to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Committed to ensuring better mobility for disabled people through smart technology, </span><a href="https://adapy.com/"><strong>Adapy Inc</strong></a><strong>.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is re-inventing the way disabled people prepare their vehicles for use. The company, through its patented innovation, enables disabled people to automate the process of preparing their vehicles for driving by tapping just a few buttons on their smartphones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Adapy was founded by </span><strong>Aaron Werner</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who was inspired by military veteran and spinal cord injury survivor </span><strong>Andrew Evans</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the two set out to perfect the technology of helping the disabled to experience greater freedom and independence. Aaron has been a vanguard in enterprise technology development for over 20 years. He has developed several software applications in the video gaming industry, marketing, and financial spaces. Owing to his motivating encounter with Andrew, he was inspired to ease the lives of people with ambulatory issues by developing a framework to bring smarter technology to the existing adaptive space.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Perfecting Technology for Greater Freedom</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While serving in the US Air Force, Andrew was wounded and was, hence, bound to a wheelchair. Hearing of Aaron&rsquo;s tech ventures, he sought him on the task of developing an idea that he had been thinking about since 2015. It was an invention that would help individuals with mobility issues just like Andrew. Although the idea was creative, it was extremely challenging as it involved designing electronic components that interfaced cloud services, mobile frameworks, and Bluetooth&reg; technologies tackling such things as automation, security, and safety.&nbsp; However, Aaron felt a desire to help those who suffer daily from mobility issues. Learning more about Andrew&rsquo;s personal trials motivated him to continue to perfect the idea into a viable product. Aaron, along with Andrew, organized a group of volunteers to assist in this project and was successful in developing it into a working product.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to test its success, Andrew plugged the prototype into his vehicle and pressed a few buttons and what was once a daunting task for someone with limited mobility became automated at the push of a button. Since its successful testing, Adapy has expanded its technology to work with most adaptive devices (wheelchair lifts, cranes, transfer seats, etc.), secured a utility patent, and started a business that helps others experience better mobility through technology.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Engineered to Simplify Lives</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapy&trade; is engineered to make life easier for millions of people with disabilities. The typical mobility and wheeling process takes up to 5-15 minutes and can become further exhaustive due to extreme outdoor temperatures of heat or cold which can make the experience go from an inconvenience to a dangerous situation. According to Aaron, people like Andrew with Spinal Cord Injuries may also lack the descending sympathetic control to respond appropriately to environmental changes in temperature. As a result, they may experience high or low body temperatures and must manage temperature dysregulation by controlling the temperature of their environment, dressing in appropriate clothing, and regulating exertion with exercise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapy&trade; allows the user to prepare their vehicle in advance from their mobile phone with a tap of a button from a safe distance. It comes pre-programmed for each adaptive device installed in the vehicle. The user simply plugs in the universal adapter to their existing lift device and downloads the mobile app, and pairs it with the device. As a result, wheelchair users can immediately enjoy full control over their vehicle&rsquo;s adaptive devices by preparing their vehicle for entry from a climate-controlled home, garage, or building without exposure to the elements. The crane, seat, lift and door controls are consolidated onto one device, their mobile phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>&ldquo;</strong>Improving the ability of Mobility&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Operating with the simple goal, of "improving the ability of mobility," Adapy seeks to improve the lives of those individuals who experience the challenges of limited mobility. The company believes it can provide a solution with innovations in modern technology that can reach a massive audience around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapy customers are made up of the 75 million people [8] that depend on wheelchairs for mobility with a narrower focus on those individuals that have experienced a spinal cord injury (SCI). According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC) [4], 282,000 persons in the U.S suffer from SCI and 17,730 new spinal cord injuries occur in the U.S. every year, with vehicular crashes being the leading cause of injury. Neurological injury to any portion of the CNS that regulates Tcore, such as SCI, stroke, multiple sclerosis, etc. frequently results in thermoregulatory dysfunction and increases the risk of morbidity and mortality from exposure to extreme ambient temperatures [2][3].&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The value proposition of the adapy solution is that it can help mitigate risks associated with these individuals' lack of descending sympathetic control to respond appropriately to environmental changes in temperature by reducing the exposure and time it takes for the end-user to ready their vehicle&rsquo;s adaptive devices in preparation for entering and exiting a vehicle in harsh weather conditions. A vehicle can be prepared for entry from a safe climate-controlled location such as a garage, residence, or building using their smartphone. The Adapy technology can reduce the time of exposure to harsh elements to under 120 seconds instead of the traditional 5-15 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Innovative Adapy Smart hub is a hardware apparatus that is designed in a way that interfaces with adaptive mobility devices. Think of it as a hub that all adaptive devices are plugged into. The Adapy Smart hub is connected to a mobile phone and mobile application via a Bluetooth&reg; connection. This connection provides the environment needed to communicate with the adaptive devices and initiate control functions such as moving a crane up and down, opening doors, and moving seats. Currently, wired remote controls manage the movement of the adaptive devices but with Adapy, the user can now control these adaptive devices from his or her mobile phone from the comfort of a climate-controlled environment. It is important to note that adaptive devices come in all forms, they may have different functions to assist with mobility, different remote controls, or communication protocols based on specific analog or digital signals and Adapy is designed to communicate with the majority of these devices.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Market&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Grand View Research [5] the global wheelchair market size was valued at USD 2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2021 to 2028. The rising population of geriatrics and the rise in the number of disorders such as spinal cord injuries requiring mobility assistance are some of the key factors driving the market. According to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center (NSCISC), approximately 17,730 new spinal cord injuries occur in the U.S. every year, with vehicular crashes being the leading cause of injury [4]. Thus, the U.S. stands as a key market for wheelchair use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Catherine Bearce Nowak, Attending Physician, Division of Genetics and Genomics at Boston&rsquo;s Children's Hospital stated, &ldquo;Assistive technologies are an important addition to physical and occupational therapy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for Adapy is not only scientifically validated through existing research studies focused on SCI and the danger of exposure to harsh environments, but it is also validated through the evolution of smart technologies such as home automation and the adoption of such technology by global markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by the Pew Research Center suggests that &ldquo;the population has reached near-saturation levels of adoption of some technologies. Put simply, in some instances there just aren&rsquo;t many non-users left. For example, nine in ten or more adults younger than 50 say they go online or own a smartphone.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you consider 75 million people worldwide, many with a smartphone in hand it becomes apparent that bridging that smartphone with their adaptive devices is not only a logical choice but it may be the one thing that revolutionizes the mobility space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Customers and Business Model&nbsp;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">75 million people worldwide need a wheelchair daily. This represents 1% of the world&rsquo;s population. In America, 13.7% of the population have issues related to mobility and there are an estimated 3.3 million wheelchair users. It is estimated that in the United States, the number of wheelchair users is expected to increase each year by 2 million.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapy's business model is very simple, to provide the Adapy Technology to users of existing adaptive devices as well as the new customers entering the space. This technology is automated and will reduce the time it takes to enter and exit a vehicle, reduce risks associated with exposure and create a community of mobile app wheelchair users for future product and service offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Adapy Smart Hub will transform old outdated cranes, lifts, or adaptive devices by giving them a new user-friendly mobile control experience without making the end-user purchase updated adaptive devices. The consumer saves money by avoiding hefty purchases of new equipment that can sometimes cost between $1000-$25,000 for a single lift.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another transformative aspect of this technology is its ability to cross-integrate with adaptive devices. Adaptive devices from various vendors are now brought together for the first time and interfaced through the Adapy Smart Hub. This provides multiple opportunities for advancement in the area of mobility and automation, since Adapy can now control all adaptive devices within the vehicle, software algorithms can be created to run multiple functions or commands that otherwise would be initiated independently. For example, a single button press or swipe of the screen on the mobile application could initiate the movement and direction of multiple adaptive devices in the sequenced order that would be required to ready the entry vehicle; this might include opening the doors, folding the lift, lowering the lift, raising the lift, folding the lift and then closing the door.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to creating routine functions of movement, the technology may also have the potential to cyber-fence the vehicle by using smart technology that recognizes when the user is within proximity of the vehicle. Using Bluetooth 4.0 and Secure Simple Pairing SSP, the Adapy Smart hub can automatically connect with the user&rsquo;s mobile phone when in range and if intended, initiate pre-arranged commands to ready the vehicle or interact with the user.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine someone with limited mobility wheeling out to their vehicle and the actual vehicle recognizing them and starting the process of preparing their vehicle for entry without any input from the user other than confirmation. The confirmation can even be an audible gesture. This is possible with Adapy and it truly is a transformative experience from what is currently being accepted in the mobility space.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such a massive potential customer base the company needed to identify the best approach to launch the product into the market. Fortunately, this space is already tamed. The company has identified over 400 existing adaptive device installers across America. These installers already work with the wheelchair communities on a local level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company&rsquo;s initial approach will be to offer an installation certification to these installers and leverage their existing reach into local communities to not only promote Adapy but also do the installation of the product. The company is also working on a partnership program with existing manufacturers of adaptive devices, who may offer a private branded or white label solution through their organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The end goal is always the same, provide freedom and independence to those with limited mobility. We believe that through strategic relationships, committed partners and our incredible technology we can accomplish this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2>Distinguished Array of Accolades</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working hand-in-hand with IP attorney Lowenstein Sandler, LLP, Aaron and Andrew were awarded a US Patent for the device they created to help those that suffer from ambulatory issues with limited mobility. Adapy&trade; states that through its innovation, disabled people will be able to automate the process of preparing their vehicles for driving by tapping just a few buttons on their smartphones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Further owing to its disruptive innovation, Adapy has been recognized with a plethora of awards and accolades. In 2021, it received the </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">ProBoPat Patent Grant Award</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by MiCasa Resource Center,</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Pitch Award</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Utah Tech University) by Atwood Innovation Plaza. In 2022, it was recognized as &lsquo;</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Startup of the Year</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&rsquo; and was the Globee Award winner. The company also received its second patent ProBoPat Patent Grant Award from the MiCasa Resource Center. Moreover, Adapy has been endorsed by ManaMed, Inc., which specializes in durable medical equipment, as well as Marc Andrus RRT, MBA, a surveyor for the Joint Commission. The company&rsquo;s technology has also been reviewed by the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Aspiring to go Beyond the Vehicle</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adapy&rsquo;s patented Smart Mobility System is ready to be offered to disabled drivers around the nation. With Adapy&rsquo;s patented device, the user will simply plug the Adapy&trade; Smart Hub into their adaptive equipment installed in or on their vehicle and pair it with the Adapy Mobile App. One app will now do the work of multiple remotes, including automated processes which are often called &lsquo;scenes&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It will also provide the opportunity to build scenes which means instead of just using it as a remote, the user can pre-record a series of movements of the adaptive equipment like a crane (think moving it into position).&nbsp; As they move the crane, the steps or movements are recorded in the app, and then the user can play it back each time they need to enter or exit their vehicle. This means that for individuals with very limited muscular control, accomplishing the various processes of prepping their vehicle will be reduced to only the single press of a button on the mobile app.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anticipating similar integrations and proliferation in the future, Adapy aims to impact the lives of millions of disabled individuals by using its patented framework to extend the concept of better mobility through automation into daily living in the next five years. Adapy&nbsp;aspires to take&nbsp;their technology beyond the vehicle and into everyday life for the&nbsp;disabled by extending its functionality to work in any environment crossing over into home automation, physical therapy equipment, extended care&nbsp;facilitates&nbsp;and more.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Key Takeaway:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;We believe we have the solution and the platform to automate everything adaptive! The key to this is our mobile app and our patented hardware which allows the protocols necessary for both analog and digital communication of the adaptive equipment. We take age-old adaptive equipment and with a simple connection to our Smart Hub, bring it into the next generation of smart devices, providing not only mobile controls but full smart automation. Adapy's technology is the first of its kind to bridge the gap between adaptive equipment and manufacturers. For the first time ever, a product created by one manufacturer can work seamlessly in an automated fashion with another piece of adaptive equipment from a completely different manufacturer, thus allowing the disabled to experience a single point of control for all of their adaptive equipment.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;</strong><strong><em>We are hopeful that millions of disabled people who operate adaptive mobility devices in conjunction with their vehicle will now be able to experience greater freedom and independence</em></strong><strong>.&rdquo;</strong></p>

RIGHTSURE has effectively tackled the shortcomings of the industry and presented affordable and reliable insurance choices which are tailored according to consumer needs.</p>
<p><em>RIGHTSURE insures everything from pets to jets.</em></p>
<p>RIGHTSURE is an independent insurance group, headquartered in Tucson Arizona, and caters to the insurance needs of 42 states across the United States. The company prides itself on the Famously Friendly Humans and Discount Discovery Technology that will help the clients save money and have a frictionless experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>How it Started</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Great Recession affected the billion-dollar financial firm and the former employees were pursuing employment. Turning the challenges into opportunities, these members laid the foundation of RIGHTSURE.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the company has acquired several agencies and is also involved in joint ventures with public and privately held firms. Its expertise and persistence have helped the company secure millions of dollars in financing and executed reinsurance measuring with billion-dollar conglomerates. RIGHTSURE is the combination of an insurance agency, insurtech, and aggregator backed by powerful AI initiatives. It gives the consumers the control of insurance process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Unique and Beneficial Propositions</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the years, the consumers have been marketed to believe that all insurance is equal and the only difference is the price (or the premium paid) while on the contrary, every single policy sold is a separate legal contract with the insurance company and if the consumer is paying less, he is most likely getting much less coverage. RIGHTSURE addressed this gap by developing Discount Discovery Technology.</p>
<p>RIGHTSURE policy comes with three very unique propositions,</p>

<p><strong>Read Full Magazine: 20 Leading Companies of the Year 2022</strong></p>189:T29b6,<p>Today in the markets, there are many opportunities to learn trading and many innovations to trading platforms. These innovations have also made trading more common for many people in their daily lives. Before this, trading was considered by many to be an area for the elites of Wall Street. With the greater availability of trading platforms like RobinHood, self-directed trading and investing platforms have brought the possibility of trading to many people. The growth of the markets and surge of interest of crypto over the last few years has made more people become interested in self-directed trading. However, this convenience has also highlighted the greater need for effective trading education and to help people better understand the risks as well as the potential rewards of trading and investing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, the number of individual, self-directed traders has expanded. The pandemic initially brought a constricting influence on the markets, but in 2021 we witnessed the explosive recovery of markets and the economy. However Jeff Bishop, Co-Founder of <strong><a href="https://ragingbull.com/" target="_blank">RagingBull.com</a></strong>, asserts, &ldquo;<em>I am cautious of the economy now as many signs are pointing to a correction coming. All the signs are there. As traders, we look for these and other signs and can look to target different types of trades depending on whether the markets are going up or down. There can generally be trades to make or trading patterns to learn from regardless of what is happening in the overall economy or markets as a whole</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Self-Taught Genius Trader&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeff Bishop holds a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Economics and is a self-taught trader, and he&rsquo;s now been a trader and trading educator for over 24 years. Originally from Texas, Jeff, his wife, and his children took a year-long road trip and eventually settled in New Hampshire. Apart from being a MENSA member and literally a genius trader, Jeff also enjoys traveling, fishing, cycling, and attends his local church where his family is involved in all community activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the years, Jeff has helped several people by sharing his extensive trading knowledge. He also shared his trading and economics wisdom with friends who asked him to teach them more about how he trades. This made him realize that quality trading education was not accessible to all. After noticing this gap Jeff, along with Jason Bond, co-founded RagingBull.com as a trading education platform in 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Exceptional Trading Education Services</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RagingBull.com&rsquo;s flagship trading education services, Bullseye Trading and Jason Bond Picks are its two stalwart services. In Bullseye Trading, subscribers gain trading education from Jeff on one of his favorite options trades each week. &ldquo;<em>I share why I think this is a good trade and provide alerts when I decide to enter or exit the trade</em>,&rdquo; explains Jeff. Under Bullseye Trading subscribers gain great trading lessons where people can learn from an experienced trader who is trading with real money and providing detailed education about that trade. Jason Bond Picks offers trading students the ability to learn from Jason&rsquo;s experience in identifying a few simple stock trading patterns and by applying these to find suitable trading examples in the markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team of trading educators at RagingBull.com share their real money trades with subscribers and offer trading education based on real trades, not only the theory of trading. The RagingBull.com live trading education rooms allows the team of trading educators to offer many of these lessons in real-time. Students can ask questions about these trades and learn from the trader&rsquo;s trading lessons about how one could apply that trading knowledge to particular trading situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Leading by Example</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a business leader, Jeff shares a great relationship with his entire team. He has built a team where every member treats RagingBull.com as their own business and thus takes calculated risks to help grow the business. RagingBull.com embraces an open work culture where the leadership team is easily accessible to help the team. Jeff likes to join different team meetings regularly to instil his business experience alongside answering questions from team members. He adds, &ldquo;<em>I think Jason and I have developed a very &ldquo;flat&rdquo; type of organization and we enjoy sharing business and trading ideas and lessons with our team at RagingBull.com</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jeff&rsquo;s leadership style is one of the key contributors to the team&rsquo;s close working style. He believes in giving people the responsibility and tools to succeed at their job. Jeff tries to lead by example and always consults with the team to discuss their successes and failures and learn from them to constantly improve. He promotes learning and believes that one should profit in both knowledge and financially from any business opportunity. &ldquo;<em>Learn from your mistakes and do what you&rsquo;ll say you do</em>,&rdquo; adds Jeff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Focus on the Bigger Goal</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being a leader means dealing with numerous challenges on the journey. For Jeff, having strong core beliefs in his marriage, family, faith, and the country has granted him a strong core set of beliefs that helps guide him through challenges. As with any business, the journey for RagingBull.com has had its share of challenges. During the pandemic in 2020 and through the early part of 2021, life continued with its normal share of surprises and events. Jeff continues, &ldquo;Our business went through some important changes during the year. Personally, <em>Jason even welcomed a new baby into his family which was a time of great joy for everyone! I think the saying &lsquo;A calm sea never made a strong sailor&rsquo; is really quite apt!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>RagingBull.com has encountered its share of challenges on the journey but Jeff and Jason have withstood those challenges to continue to build a successful business. Jeff shares that the key has been to focus on the end goal and always to take measured risks. In his journey as a trader, he has witnessed several traders becoming emotionally invested in the outcome of the trade, rather than sticking with their education and principles and focusing on the bigger goal. Being persistent towards the goal rewarded RagingBull.com with an incredible 2020 where the company continued its growth (and outstanding 831%!) and also won an Inc 5000 award.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Making the Most of Crisis</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2020 allowed RagingBull.com to reflect on any business gaps and shortcomings and plan for their next phase of growth. The team invested in improving their educational offerings to help the succeed in their trading. The team also ensured that the customer support and compliance teams were there to serve the growing customer base and prepare for the next phase of growth in 2022. RagingBull.com recently launched new trading services including a digital currency &ndash; AKA crypto &ndash; trading education service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeff balances his time between his professional and personal life. While he directs the changes and upgrades as a business leader, he also enjoys family time and pursues his personal passions of fishing and cycling.&nbsp; Quoting his experience, Jeff states, &ldquo;<em>It&rsquo;s funny when looking back, people used to say they wanted to commute less, spend more time with their loved ones and work from home. I think there are many blessings that the pandemic brought as well as the many challenges that many families have faced</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Improving the Educational Offerings</strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pandemic brought along the trend of remote working and it is anticipated to stay for the foreseeable future. With the advancements of technology operating a business remotely is easier and many companies were forced to explore their available options. Jeff anticipates that these advancements will lead to better tools within trading and investing platforms. He also sees the ability to incorporate these different tools into trading along with digital currencies and crypto.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the coming year, the goals for RagingBull.com will continue to be improving trading education offerings to cover different types of trading. For example, it recently launched the first digital currency trading service which has already proven popular with subscribers. &ldquo;<em>I predict the market is up for a change. Many of the economic indicators point to correction</em>,&rdquo; asserts Jeff. This will serve as an opportunity for RagingBull.com, as it can share with people how to navigate markets no matter what happens. This will help our team to establish RagingBull.com as a trusted source of quality trading and investing education.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Key takeaway: </strong>&ldquo;Keeping your eye on the end goal and always taking measured risks. Not getting too tied emotionally to the successes or failures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Never give up, and follow your dreams with drive and focus! My mum used to create her own handicrafts and sell them at local events. She&rsquo;d often work to try and make ends meet but she had a strong work ethic that she passed onto me. Years back I was working in a car dealership. Much of that time was spent by me learning more about trading. I eventually got fired from that job which helped me focus even more on trading! I built that into trading full-time and sharing my trading knowledge with people. That grew into RagingBull.com which allowed me to share my trading knowledge with more people and to contribute back some of my good fortune with others and with worthy causes. Stay focused and work hard for your goals. Always try to give back to others who might need help</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the utilization of technological resources, sustainability becomes a factor that no one can ignore these days. Large and even small-scale enterprises have realized the essence of sustainable and eco-friendly ways of technology integration to upscale the lifecycle of their business and enhance the lifestyle of their people. One company operating with the commitment to create a future where all energy is consumed from sustainable sources, sustained by a public that understands and values the social, economic, and environmental benefits that green energy provides is <a href="https://www.duesenbergtech.com/"><strong>Duesenberg Technologies Inc.</strong></a></p>
<p>The company continues the tradition of incorporating the most advanced technologies and utilizing the finest built qualities for its electrified vehicles. It has made the legendary brand, the leader in the upper luxury market from the 20th century in the modern design models of the electrified Duesenberg vehicles. This tradition even extends to the limited edition classic models as well as other related vehicles that are in the pipeline for the electrified vehicle segment.</p>
<p>There are no compromises on the selection and use of the most reputable European and American technology partners in the development and implementation of Duesenberg Electric Drive and Energy Storage Units. The electric vehicle platforms have the capability of adoption by other OEM clients worldwide and strategic assembly whose setup is in the USA and Europe as well as Asia for certain development and work.</p>
<p>Duesenberg is a brand that has a rich history that shows the world&rsquo;s finest cars as being derived from the research and development of racing cars. This decade has shown that today&rsquo;s world has come up with sustainable technologies, which allows the company to be a technological leader. When the brand was at its inception, it was on the path of creating the world&rsquo;s finest automobiles with carbon-neutrality at the core of its technologies along with application and integration of hydrogen being the ultimate ambition.</p>
<p><em>Before strolling over the story of Duesenberg, let&rsquo;s walk through the profile of the person who made this possible with his quintessential leadership and magnificent winning attitude.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Celestial Leader </strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.duesenbergtech.com/about">Joe Lim Hun Beng</a> is attributed with acquainting motorsports with China, presently the world's greatest vehicle market and it is fitting that the Chinese engine racing clique remembers him as the "Father of Motorsports" of the first engine racing circuit in China in the mid 1990's.</p>
<p>Mr. Lim holds a good command over English, Mandarin and Cantonese, all three languages of which were essential to introduce the European culture of motorsports into Cantonese centric southern China while Mandarin was the formal language of the policy makers in Beijing. An amiable familiarity with motorsports personalities in Hong Kong, Macao, London and Paris where the world motorsports authority &ndash; the FIA &ndash; is headquartered were also crucial to introduce world-class motorsports to China when most people didn&rsquo;t have driving licenses in the 1990&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Mr. Lim bought the Duesenberg IP and all the rights to the brand and manufacturing facilities from the last owners in the US about 10 years ago and incorporated them under the Hampshire Group Ltd and Duesenberg Technologies Inc, both of which he officiates as president and CEO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Transformational Journey</strong></p>
<p>Duesenberg was formerly known as VGrab Communications Inc. It was established out of the collective ambition of investors experienced in online business and marketing. Their goal was to help entrepreneurs and businesses turn their own ideas and visions into successful companies, and they have also managed to back many success stories so far. On 30th December 2020, the company rebranded itself as Duesenberg Technologies Inc., embarking on facilitating environment-friendly technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.duesenbergtech.com/copy-of-about-us-1">The company&rsquo;s vision</a> is to hand over a more technologically advanced biodiverse, and liveable planet Earth to the next generation. It wants to create a global green clean energy platform and ecosystem for everyone. &ldquo;Our mission is to protect the diversity of our environment and quality of life, now and for future generations,&rdquo; states <strong>Joe Lim Hun-Beng, Founder</strong> and <strong>CEO </strong>of the brand<strong>. </strong>For Duesenberg, the goal is to be climate neutral across its full value chain, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The company is committed to energy resiliency through development in Energy Transition goals. This strategy identifies an immediate and urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change, reduce energy use, and improve air quality. &ldquo;We believe that we can play a vital role in supporting all three of these objectives by reducing the environmental impacts,&rdquo; says Mr. Lim.</p>
<p>The Duesenberg brand is filled with a rich heritage and Mr. Lim feels obligated to remain true to this heritage. The new Duesenberg series of models are designed by a heralded European designer incorporating the key DNA of the Duesenberg of the 1930s. For the avid collectors of Duesenberg vehicles, the brand resumes the manufacturing of a number of machining chassis, replicating the original classic Duesenberg cars using all bespoke materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Displaying Dynamic Leadership</strong></p>
<p>German and US automakers had started to make and sell cars in joint ventures with <a href="https://www.duesenbergtech.com/corporatenews">Chinese state owned</a> entities such as SAIC and BAIC. Informal street racing became popular in affluent special economic zones in the southern parts of China such as Guangdong. Mr. Lim saw the opportunity to converge his family interests in property development and his personal passion in motor racing. His influential Chinese business associates were keen to harness the local demand and promote motorsports to international levels, especially at the top levels of the Formula 1 Grand Prix. As a Malaysian Chinese.</p>
<p>Bolstered by his team of businessmen and influential Chinese central and provincial government officials, Mr. Lim as the deputy chairman and general manager of the Zhuhai International Circuit Ltd, managed to get the track constructed, inspected, and ready on time for the first FIA-sanctioned race in 1994. There&rsquo;s also a golf course, one of China&rsquo;s first, that Mr. Lim integrated into the property development.</p>
<p>It was during this intense period that Mr. Lim had the vision that he would like to be a small volume manufacturer of a top-level car, one with a history of a very elite customer base. Something like Duesenberg, a legendary car from the 1930s, and the first American car to win an FIA championship in Europe. It was a type of car that attracted the cr&egrave;me-de-la-cr&egrave;me of society. Mr. Lim bought the Duesenberg IP and all the rights to the brand and manufacturing facilities from the last owners in the US about 10 years ago and incorporated them under the Hampshire Group Ltd., and Duesenberg Technologies Inc., both of the firms he officiates as president and CEO.</p>
<p>Duesenberg&rsquo;s team under the guidance of Mr. Lim is planning to be a pioneer in the field of Green Mobility. The company&rsquo;s driveline function is designed from the ground up with electrification and carbon-neutrality as core values. The car with this functionality will have the latest in electric motor technology from Germany. According to Mr. Lim, mobility will be shaped by legacy carmakers. It is being shaped by Elon Musk/Tesla, to name a person, by big data, and vendors in the semiconductor industry like Foxconn, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Driving Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>Lim&rsquo;s exposure to his professional endeavors in China, bringing in the top level of motorsports to China has given him a level of reputation in the international automotive community that money can&rsquo;t buy. Duesenberg and a group of companies have a supply chain spanning the US, Europe, and Asia. The cost-effective supply chain is its strength. &ldquo;We have a high-powered pool of talent drawn from international engineering software, the US and European automotive community, and a cost-effective and innovative supply chain from Asia,&rdquo; conveys Mr. Lim. The world is transitioning to EV&rsquo;s faster than most people imagine. Thinking five years down the line, affordability is relative. US-China joint-ventures will lead the way in affordable EV motoring.</p>
<p>More than this however, Lim&rsquo;s current drive is into the bespoke level of carbon neutral automobility based on an iconic brand, Duesenberg, and fortuitously blessed by the US Congress which last year passed a bill permitting small volume manufacturing of heritage cars.</p>
<p>Ecology, Innovate, Electrify, and Mobilize will be the goals towards Duesenberg Technologies Inc.&rsquo;s contribution towards environmental sustainability. &ldquo;Pandemic was very challenging for all of us, and we survived by keeping progression in mind,&rdquo; shares Mr. Lim. The company will introduce three product lines: a brand extension for a limited edition (1000 a year) fun sports car in 2 power trims and 2WD or AWD in the next 3 years.</p>
<p>Its team is also planning to launch the heritage Duesenberg as an EV limited as per the US law permitting heritage car production. &ldquo;We are at the forefront of electrification and working with a new tech motor from Germany. This new tech electric motor disrupts the traditional stator design by a multifold power performance and/or size factor,&rdquo; concludes Mr. Lim</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quote</strong>: &ldquo;We intend to revolutionize the mobility and transport industry with driveline electrification and power source based on green hydrogen for commercial vehicles and marine mobility&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>18b:T3793,<p><strong><a href="https://www.officiumlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Officium Labs</a> has been recognized as one of the <a href="../../../magazine/20-Best-Companies-to-Watch-of-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 Best Companies to Watch of 2021</a>&nbsp;by </strong><a href="../../../" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Executive Headlines</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.officiumlabs.io/foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foundation </a>began with four leading people. In the year 2019, they received an idea to explore the field of customer experience. They wanted to change the older way customer experience was working and present a new example before the world. With this idea and a loan of $150k, they took their first aviation. In these two years, they grew as a global workforce the revenue currently is over $10M and they are serving over 22 clients.</p>
<p>They achieved success because the market was ready to accept this change and this enterprise was ready to provide it. While companies lose revenue of $339B only because the customers get poor services, this enterprise is helping them to retrieve from that loss by their best-in-class services with a flexible workforce. The flexibility can be seen as they evolved themselves for the market according to the situation during the covid pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with Jonathan Shroyer, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Officium Labs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Tell us about your key operations in the market? </strong></p>
<p>Being an entirely decentralized company they find their roots in blockchain and cryptocurrency. Due to similar philosophies, they can manage around the market. They say "you can hire talented people anywhere in the world and provide them a flexible, purposeful work and they will enable happy clients".&nbsp; To date, they are working with employees in Europe, North America, and Asia.</p>
<p><strong>What is the concept of Connect, Transform, Innovate at Officium labs?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.officiumlabs.io/innovate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Officium Labs</a> is working on creating seamless customer service through their brands " Connect, Transform, and Innovate". The brand "Connect" works as a network of on-demand, best-in-class customer service resources. They are working to bring "great people together with great brands" so they can achieve extraordinary service steadily without any hindrance with peak volume spikes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Transform&rdquo; works on bringing their extraordinary CX procedure to existence. It is done by "consulting, coaching, training and our award-winning Foundational Services Workshop". &ldquo;Innovate&rdquo; is a technology arena where companies can attain enhanced outcomes, this is done by the use of analytics and operative tools.</p>
<p><strong>Tell us about the CX Self Service Maturity Model? How beneficial is it?</strong></p>
<p>With their CX Maturity Model, they are helping the employment authorities to "generate and protect revenue" with their distinct ServiceStack&trade; technology. They correlate the impact of great service with the impact on the organizations' financial performance, which enables them to demonstrate the strategic role played by CX. "The bottom line is that happy customers spend more, stay loyal longer, and help to bring new customers your way".</p>
<p>In these 2 years, they have proven over 15 times that "CXAAS (customer experience as a service) drives savings to the bottom line and protects top-line growth".</p>
<p>Here are a few ServiceStack client wins achieved and provided by the foundation:</p>
<p>One of the clients had to say that "WFM saves 24% in BPO spend".</p>
<p>Another said that "White Glove MVP protects $5M".</p>
<p>One another client added that "Agent AI assist decreases BPO spend by 25%".</p>
<p>A client happy with the service said "Connect Burst scaled 100 resources in a few weeks to meet volume demand".</p>
<p>Another such client said that "CXAAS transformation drives a 55% increase in customer satisfaction".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What made you design the CX Self Service Maturity Model?</strong></p>
<p>For this question, their answer was "We wanted to enlighten our clients on a better way to bring LTV, customer effort, and customer retention to the forefront of their success". They found that the service market was shattered because a lot of companies were "splintering their customer journey and not focusing on the results and outcomes of the journey.&nbsp; They were more focused on segments". To solve this they decided to design their model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Describe to us your technology solutions, associations, and partnerships. What new innovations can we expect shortly?</strong></p>
<p>We have done many case studies on AI Agent Assist that remodels how agents engage with clients. Moreover, our intense strength in BI supported by programs like Burst and White Glove are fundamental differentiators in where we are running. The operations head and the tech employees are obliged to lead a global workforce that will surpass 10,000 by the year 2025. Besides, we are one of the leading service organizations to take cryptocurrency as payment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How effective is your company from an operational standpoint of view?</strong></p>
<p>All non-core team is on-demand, so our crew lines up just in time when the client demands it. Besides, it is quite related to how AWS does its web services. Some folks call us the AWS of human capital. Our back-end WFM system allows this real-time allocation, accompanying the people we hire looking for a more flexible work style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How does the organization equip itself for uncertainty?</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What challenges did you face in your initial years? What can your peers learn from it?</strong></p>
<p>Some of the challenges that came along with that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensuring that my vision was well-articulated and that I had the support of my colleagues to bring this vision into fruition.</li>
<li>Time management was a constant challenge as I had far too many things on my plate to handle. I felt overwhelmed at times and could not manage my time effectively.</li>
<li>I had to ensure that all the holdings&rsquo; policies and procedures are in-line with the company&rsquo;s aspirations, goals, and overall culture. It was a challenge to ensure that all employees were adhering to these policies and procedures whilst ensuring that we continuously growing as a company.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Earning trust and respect of consumers all around the world is through consistent focus on delivering high quality in all of our actions,&rdquo; how do you interpret this statement?</strong></p>
<p>This statement is crucial to the success of any company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any company that wishes to ensure a high percentage of customer retention must deliver high-quality products and services at all-times. It is of much importance that the customer life-cycle management is well-thought out and adhered to accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Enerkon, we pride ourselves in being customer obsessed. We realize the importance and the need to provide high-quality products and services to our clients to maintain a successful, long-term business relationship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Working with the federal government is no easy task. Our consistent efforts to provide high-quality products and services have certainly allowed us to earn the federal government&rsquo;s trust and business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fostering a culture of feedback is crucial to the success of every organization. How is this true within your company?</strong></p>
<p>Enerkon appreciates the importance of receiving constant feedback &ndash; whether from internal or external stakeholders.</p>
<p>Internal stakeholders always aim to provide constructive feedback that allows Enerkon to fine-tune our processes, enhance our products and services offering, and ensure customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Equally, we are constantly seeking feedback from our external stakeholders (the federal government, in this case) about ways we can further improve our products and services offering. We execute that through regular review meetings in which we solicit this feedback from our clients and then return to Enerkon to find ways to make things happen for our clients to ensure their satisfaction is realized accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About adaptability, how do you stay relevant to the consumer interests and needs in this highly volatile market?</strong></p>
<p>The nature of this highly volatile market, especially at these times, requires that we pay close attention to the needs and the interest of our clients along with keeping a close eye on our competitors and the way they are adapting accordingly as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Involving our consumers directly in our decision-making process is a strategy that has worked out quite well for Enerkon. We make decisions based on the demands and the needs of our customers to ensure that we adhere to their needs and to their requirements. This strategy further allows us to learn more about the government&rsquo;s preferences and avoid potential losses that we may face from investing in products and services that may not be of interest to our clients; thus, resulting in immobile assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are constantly holding best practice sessions within Enerkon to learn more about the ways in which our competitors are offering their products and their services to their own clients. This allows us to further fine-tune our offering to ensure that we are one-step ahead of our competition by offering the latest and the greatest products and services to our own clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you have to list five factors that have been/are the biggest asset to your organization, what would they be, and why?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Employees: Our most valuable asset is our workforce. As they are responsible for our company&rsquo;s success, we are constantly investing in our employees to ensure that we give them the opportunity to be successful at what they do.</li>
<li>Knowledge and Skills: These intangible assets assist in defining and establishing the identity of our company. We are constantly focusing on enhancing this area to ensure that our employees are empowered with the knowledge and the skillset that they need to meet our customers&rsquo; needs and requirements.</li>
<li>Liquidity: Ensuring that we are constantly liquid to continue our operations and to build and deliver to our customers&rsquo; needs and requirements is of much importance. This is realized by building a pipeline of customers who are already interested in our products and services offering.</li>
<li>Patents: Our product offering is unique. We have taken the appropriate measures to ensure that our offering is legally protected from any potential infringement of our copyrights.</li>
<li>Customers: Enerkon would not exist or be successful at what we do without our clients. Hence, everything we execute at our company is done with the ultimate goal of meeting and satisfying our customers&rsquo; needs and requirements.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer service varies, but companies can still be successful. How do you maintain your customers&rsquo; trust and loyalty?</strong></p>
<p>At&nbsp;<a href="https://enerkoninternational.com/alternative-energy-green-hydrogen-epc-contracts/"><strong>Enerkon</strong></a>, we strongly believe in providing our customers with up-to-date, high-quality products and services at a fair price. As a result, our company earns our customers&rsquo; trust and loyalty by staying current with industry trends and by not taking advantage of them from a pricing perspective. By doing so, we are also guaranteeing that we improve the quality of our products and our services while still offering them at a competitive price.</p>
<p>We also believe in operating with complete transparency with our customers. Therefore, we tend to keep our customers abreast all the latest developments within Enerkon from a product roadmap perspective, as well as, from the changing industry standards. By doing so, we tend to manage our customers&rsquo; expectations (through avoiding overpromising on our deliverables), as well as ensuring that our customers are well-versed with the industry&rsquo;s hottest and most in-demand needs and requirements to ensure that they also remain competitive with their offering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What do you feel are the reasons behind your company&rsquo;s reputation?</strong></p>
<p>Our company&rsquo;s reputation has been recognized through our offering of high-quality products and services at a fair price. Moreover, we have successfully managed to provide consistent non-chargeable product provisioning and check-up services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furnishing/servicing our products for our customers while adhering to specific legal requirements (such as ensuring that products have not been tampered with by another external organization) and providing the consistent delivery of high-quality goods and services has always kept us at the top of our game.</p>
<p>We are delighted to share that due to our company&rsquo;s reputation, our existing customers have referred us to new customers who would be potentially interested in our offering and establishing a business relationship with Enerkon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do you and your company contribute to the global I.T. platform and society at large?</strong></p>
<p>I.T. is our most important communication channel and the only safe way to install renewable energy equipment within the EPC facility (engineering, procurement, and construction).</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, our company is one of the most significant users of information technology. As a result, we support I.T. companies and platforms by purchasing their products and services and incorporating them within our own solutions to further meet customer needs and requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, several of our team members are also closely monitoring and investigating some of the I.T. issues, which are relevant to our industry, and relaying this feedback through the appropriate I.T. forums to further enhance their respective offering, for the good of Enerkon, in specific, and society, in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When companies are involved in social welfare/CSR activities, what do you say about this?</strong></p>
<p>Corporate Social Responsibility is something that should never be taken lightly by any company out there. As a company, we are not only responsible for ensuring that we remain profitable. We also have the responsibility of ensuring that we do so in the most ethical manner as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our products and services must also be benefitting the society in which we are part of, and are in no way posing any harm to the environment we live in.</p>
<p>Moreover, we also need to ensure that we are actively involved in giving back to the community through volunteer work which would benefit society as a whole.</p>
<p>Ultimately, when a company is behaving in a corporate socially responsible manner, this allows society to feel more interested in the company&rsquo;s business, products, and services. Hence, when a community feels connected to a company, the company&rsquo;s business performance along with its financial stability become a shared concern. Therefore, it becomes a win-win situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As a question on sustainability, where do you see your company a couple of years from now?</strong></p>
<p>Given the success we have realized thus far, I am confident that our company will continue to deliver excellence to a wider range of customers, both nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Our client-base will serve not only government entities but also private and public entities in need of our products and services offering.</p>
<p>We will establish relationships and expand our reach to global clients to ensure that we become a leader in this space on the international front as well.</p>
<p>As a result, we will establish physical presence in different parts of the world, thus leading to hiring new employees and increasing our market reach within these regions, respectively.</p>
<p>This will ultimately lead not only to an increase in our customer-base but will also bring further value and returns to our shareholders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>191:T22ef,<p>Factors such as digitization, internationalization and the increasingly widespread use of IoT and mobile devices are fueling the complexity of today&rsquo;s corporate networks as well as the task of safeguarding against hackers, business espionage, etc. Also, with the commencement of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018, businesses are obliged to ensure &ldquo;adequate protection&rdquo; through &ldquo;suitable technical measures&rdquo; to prevent the loss of their data. However, in parallel, IT departments are constantly understaffed in many businesses, causing problems to be dealt with too late, which in effect leads to high costs.</p>

<p>To address this issue, they can benefit from software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) network technology which lays the foundation for efficient, centralized protection from the cloud. This network technology is more cost-efficient as well as the set-up, installation, and maintenance take much less time and resources. Besides, the SD-WAN creates a &ldquo;sealed corporate network&rdquo; across all sites, creating the basis for centralized, comprehensive enterprise protection against outside attacks, for example through the implementation of a powerful Next Generation Firewall. It makes sense to move the security stack to the cloud to ensure optimum connectivity with the network and security functionalities, and using a firewall-as-a-service, in this case, makes for a viable choice. This is where&nbsp;Secucloud&nbsp;comes into the picture and is offering this solution in the form of &ldquo;Secucloud Enterprise Solutions&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>A Trusted &amp; Reliable Security&nbsp;Partner Fighting Against Cybercriminals</strong></p>

<p>Established in 2013, Secucloud produces&nbsp;Cybersecurity&nbsp;made in Germany&rdquo;, which means: IT security solutions in unison with the highest quality standards and the world&rsquo;s strictest data protection laws, the German ones. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;trusted&nbsp;and&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;security&nbsp;partner,&nbsp;the company assists&nbsp;its&nbsp;clients&nbsp;in&nbsp;defending&nbsp;their&nbsp;networks&nbsp;and&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;data&nbsp;against&nbsp;hackers&nbsp;and&nbsp;cybercriminals. More importantly, its solutions don&rsquo;t contain any kind of backdoors that would allow third party access to the systems of its clients&ndash; a fact proven by the German &ldquo;TeleTrust&rdquo; quality seal.</p>

<p>Secucloud believes that in order to fight against cybercriminals, security providers need to display a very high level of innovation. So, by harnessing the latest state-of-the-art technology, it is constantly fighting against hackers and criminals in a struggle to outdo one another. Furthermore, the company is leveraging evolving technologies and fostering innovation to stay ahead from its competitors. For example, Secucloud is currently working on ways of utilizing artificial intelligence in the form of neural networks to classify network traffic. Ideally, a neural network would be able to recognize and identify the continuously changing and evolving harmful data streams on the internet &ndash; not based on known attack patterns, but rather thanks to a true understanding of the difference between good and bad network traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering a Comprehensive, Enterprise-Class Security System</strong></p>

<p>As an international security specialist, Secucloud offers a comprehensive, enterprise-class security system that is located exclusively in the cloud to meet the demands of the clients. Through its solutions, clients can protect their networks and devices from today&rsquo;s increasingly sophisticated cyber-threats in a centralized way. As a result, they do not need to install any applications on their computers, nor do they need to keep local security solutions up to date on a continuous basis.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the company&rsquo;s offering is directed at telcos, which can implement its solution directly in their infrastructure. Then, provide their customers with its high-performance security in the form of a subscription-based service. The solutions offered by Secucloud cover large customer bases: 100 million users and more can be protected at the same time.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the company offers its security technology as a managed service in the B2B area, in the form of &ldquo;Secucloud Enterprise Solutions&rdquo;. It enables vendors and resellers to act as Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs) and provide small and medium-sized businesses with a suite of powerful security technologies that scale as needed and stay up-to-date without any maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>EmergingTechnology with Vast Potential: FWaaS</strong></p>

<p>Firewall as a Service (FWaaS) is emerging as an important technology trend that will revolutionize the market in the near future. FWaaS has enormous market potential in the increasing threat environment today that demands an extremely high degree of IT infrastructure reliability and versatility from a business. At the same time, the costs of ensuring an adequate level of protection mustn&rsquo;t go sky high. This is where FWaaS comes into play and offers corresponding functionalities that are obtained as a service from the cloud. Accordingly, they remain up-to-date at all times, adapt flexibly to the requirements of the company and thereby reduce maintenance and configuration costs. With Secucloud Enterprise Solutions, the leading cybersecurity solution providing company recognized this need at a very early stage in the past and leveraged the technology trend with a concrete solution for its customers. Furthermore, as early as 2017, Gartner included the technology in its hype cycle, calling it one of the emerging technologies (&ldquo;on the rise&rdquo;), and gave it a &lsquo;high&rsquo; benefit rating. Even then, Gartner named Secucloud as one of the few vendors for this emerging technology trend.</p>

<p><strong>The Industrious Leader Leading Towards A Bright Future</strong></p>

<p>A technology entrepreneur,&nbsp;Dennis Monner&nbsp;is the&nbsp;Founder&nbsp;and&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of&nbsp;Secucloud. Prior to founding Secucloud, he acted as founder and chairman of the executive board of the IT security manufacturer gateprotect, which was taken over by Rohde &amp; Schwarz Cybersecurity in 2014. The company was able to outperform 500 international competitors and is considered today to be among the top 10 in the industry, ranking in the Magic Quadrant by the Gartner consulting firm.</p>

<p>To highlight his thoughts on leadership, Dennis shares, &ldquo;In my opinion, steering a company compares very well with sailing. As a captain on a ship, I have to set the course and stay focused on our destination. And no matter how big a ship is, we all have one thing in common: We move on the power of the wind. It is our best friend &ndash; it figuratively as well as literally offers tailwind &ndash; but sometimes can also be our worst enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The industrious leader has to manage all the business operations as well as has to lead, guide his team members to achieve the goals set by the core management team. He also credits the success and growth of Secucloud to his team as they have put lots of effort and hard work to make it as huge it is today.</p>

<p><strong>Wide Clientele Base</strong></p>

<p>Secucloud has reached just under 1 billion subscribers around the world through its international partnerships and group contracts with multiple well-known telcos. CEO Dennis proudly asserts, &ldquo;Examples, for successful Secucloud implementations at renowned companies are the Ooredoo Group &ndash; with 130 million customers one of the leading international telecoms providers for the Middle East, North Africa, and south-east Asia &ndash; or VinaPhone &ndash;&nbsp; with more than nine million mobile customers the second-largest mobile provider in Vietnam.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Emerging Network Technologies is the Future</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;The past year was a very successful one for our company. In fact, the growing interest in the megatrends SD-WAN and FWaaS have given us a great boost, enabling us to develop Secucloud Enterprise Solutions as a further field of application for our innovative cloud solution and to provide our customers with new offerings,&rdquo; comments CEO Dennis. Now, the versatile leader with his team is planning to continue benefiting from the additional momentum this year and push ahead with the Managed Security Services business &ndash; both nationally and internationally. By leveraging several years of experience in the global cloud security business, the company is now the ideal solution provider and consulting partner for any reseller who wants to provide their customers with a powerful protection technology adequate for today&rsquo;s requirements.</p>

Her approach not only caters to the special needs of these extraordinary singles but also prioritizes individualized experience to support her clients in finding love in the long term.

Authentic living may have never been more urgent in the cacophony of noise that surrounds lives. <strong>RealSpot </strong>is perhaps the most refreshing app about empowering users to take ownership of their own narrative&mdash;recording their lives in all simplicity.</p>
<p>RealSpot is a kind of online version of the roll film camera where people can take almost instant pictures of their favorite places without thinking about cropping or deleting the overthought moments. This way, it lets people live in the moment and keep memories, as well as connect with other people. Using RealSpot, individuals can create their own collection of "REAL" photos of their lives and build profiles of the locally preferred businesses as well.</p>
<p>Under the helm is <strong>Suzanne Martin</strong>, <strong>CEO, </strong>who is sharply passionate about changing how we relate to our memories as well as the world at large. Just when the disposable cameras became cool, RealSpot frees a user from traditional social anxiety and self-doubts. It is actual spontaneity that puts its emphasis on what is of key interest to users&mdash;such as the ability to help build communities and live life as if it really happens.</p>
<p>The app has a lively "vibes page" where people can find new hotspots and share their experiences with others. While recording their trips, they not only save their memories but also help the survival of local businesses, which is important for the life of the community. RealSpot is thus a bright spot of positivity in these uncertain times that urges people to be themselves and uplift the people around them.</p>
<p><strong>Journey from Artist to Tech Visionary</strong></p>
<p>For Suzanne Martin, CEO of RealSpot, the path from artist to tech entrepreneur is paved by creativity, love for humanity, and a transformative approach to social media. For her, artistic expression merged with a vision of change, which led to building RealSpot as an authentic platform that values honesty above traditional social media metrics.</p>
<p>Looking back at my childhood, my artistic life had shaped the path of my life. My first few steps off mainstream social media led to a realization of the limitations of validation and comparison that online creates. Suzanne reveals how, as an artist, "my expression found depth in lyrics embedded in abstract art," pointing out that music opened ways for emotional connection. This led to the realization of RealSpot&mdash;the place where moments are snapped and voiced by song lyric expressions beyond mere words.</p>
<p>As RealSpot began to stretch its wings, Suzanne based the value of her firm on the integration of artistic authenticity and technology. Suzanne dreamed of a social website that could capture the very soul of every moment music brings with it in a manner that would share meaningful relationships between users and others. "Imagine this, a memory captured within a song, beyond an ordinary caption," Suzanne thought. An idea became full-fledged, an entirely new ecosystem that redefines the very core of the essence of social media.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Social Media with a Focus on Authenticity</strong></p>
<p>As RealSpot expanded, Suzanne ventured into uncharted territories, discovering the intricate workings of the business model on social media. RealSpot was no longer a photo-sharing app but an authentic social platform focusing on community engagement and local business support. Suzanne reimagined the features of RealSpot, moving from likes and comments to a more authentic user experience. "We wanted to redefine social media," she states. "We learned from our peers in the industry and designed something uniquely ours."</p>
<p>Given this focus on true community engagement, all things in the app that were seen as creating social media fatigue got eliminated. The main attraction at RealSpot is genuine user interaction aimed at enhancing personal and community connection. Suzanne's design supports and encourages a wholesome, meaningful online presence wherein users truly live the world, free from the mediative lens of filtering.</p>
<p><strong>Building Community-Centric Values</strong></p>
<p>There are four guiding principles at the heart of RealSpot's mission: people as influencers, using locals as a source to get recommendations, music serving as the glue that is going to tie it up, and cash incentives as some form of a reward mechanism. Suzanne feels that, as a marketplace, this is three-sided user-generated content where community tie-in is bound through connection with local businesses. The speaker details that each photograph tells three stories at three different locations and how RealSpot refashioned the same photograph to be a personal memory, a public feed, and a vibe-curated page to enhance local involvement.</p>
<p>It puts the community front and center. Because the company focuses on a neighborhood or local business location when creating personal galleries, this new business model empowers small businesses to identify and locate customers in an unprecedented, dynamic form of interaction that turns its users into advocates for commerce in their locality. By emphasizing ties to the community as well as to local culture, RealSpot provides business companies with a refreshing route from mainstream social advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Authenticity Meets Responsible Technology</strong></p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s emphasis on unfiltered, real-life moments aligns with its tech-forward philosophy. Suzanne explains, "Our users find value in sharing their experiences without altering their images." By sidestepping filters and avoiding features that encourage heavy editing, RealSpot champions a responsible use of technology that values honesty. Suzanne emphasizes this commitment: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about fostering connections through our true selves&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a local coffee shop or a hidden gem on the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s mapping feature is designed to connect users with their surrounding businesses in real-time. Partnered businesses pay for enhanced map visibility, allowing them to offer special promotions like &ldquo;25% off&rdquo; that appear directly on users&rsquo; screens. This feature encourages users to discover local venues, reinforcing the app&rsquo;s role in supporting small businesses and building community ties.</p>
<p><strong>The Local Impact</strong></p>
<p>In Sayulita, a coastal town in Mexico, RealSpot&rsquo;s impact has been transformative. Suzanne recalls meeting a vibrant local woman braiding hair on the beach&mdash;a friendship that illustrated the app&rsquo;s potential. Suzanne helped this small business owner showcase her skills on RealSpot, allowing her to move from handwritten bookings to a thriving business model, all through the app&rsquo;s real-time location sharing.</p>
<p>This local success story became a model for RealSpot&rsquo;s impact on small businesses. By focusing on everyday interactions and connections, Suzanne empowers users to highlight the unique elements of their communities. Her experiences in Sayulita reflect RealSpot&rsquo;s core mission: a platform that strengthens community bonds by giving voice to small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>A New Era of Influencer Marketing</strong></p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s upcoming launch in Knoxville, Tennessee, signifies a step forward in modern influencer marketing. As Suzanne outlines, RealSpot&rsquo;s "spotters,&rdquo; or influencers, will soon have the opportunity to earn rewards for their local engagement. The phased launch introduces rewards for visiting local businesses, allowing influencers to participate fairly in the app&rsquo;s growing community.</p>
<p>Suzanne&rsquo;s innovative approach to influencer marketing doesn&rsquo;t seek to replace traditional methods but rather supplements them with authenticity. By enabling spotters to engage with multiple businesses and earn, Suzanne hopes to provide a platform that celebrates local influencers, staying true to RealSpot&rsquo;s mission of highlighting community connections and everyday experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Paving the Way for Global Localized Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Suzanne envisions a future where RealSpot becomes a local community platform for towns around the world. With its unique model, RealSpot provides users with real-time insights on businesses and places within their zip code. Suzanne believes this can shift economic power into the hands of communities themselves, bridging local and digital economies in a revolutionary way.</p>
<p>Unlike typical social platforms, RealSpot is built to complement rather than compete, incorporating advances made since the early days of social media. Suzanne likens this evolution to the innovation in cooking or technology&mdash;where progress doesn't negate the past but builds upon it. RealSpot&rsquo;s trajectory is one that aims to revitalize and transform the digital landscape, inspired by a respect for community and culture.</p>
<p><strong>The Woman Behind RealSpot</strong></p>
<p>Resilience and vision defined the journey of an artist turned CEO&mdash;Suzanne Martin, a true New Jersey native&mdash;who beats Silicon Valley odds by creating RealSpot and continues the beat. Deemed the "Elle Woods of Silicon Valley," the brand Technically Blonde is the backbone for RealSpot and more ventures in development.</p>
<p>From volunteering in her community to raising her children, Suzanne's impact reaches far beyond her business. Her story, forged in a perfect blend of tenacity and creative spirit, inspires women in tech and beyond. Clearly, it is her mission to solve world problems through innovation, both determined and authentic. As she puts it, "Creating RealSpot was never about competition&mdash;it's about making the world more connected, one community at a time.".</p>198:T2a2e,<p>In a technology-driven world, artificial intelligence is the greatest challenge before integrating technology into life.

And <strong>SoftPak Financial Systems</strong> has been at the forefront since 1994.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founded by <strong>Naaz Scheik</strong>, who was initially a quant analyst at Wellington Management, SoftPak has established itself as an innovation company in financial technology. With its headquarters in Sudbury, Massachusetts, and offices located all over the world, the company has successfully collaborated with some of the world's largest investment firms to process more than $500 billion in assets under management (AUM) via its advanced software solutions,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The core philosophy behind SoftPak is to cooperate; understanding the clients' needs are what have led them to design cost-effective and efficient solutions. Their flagship products such as the Universal Rebalancer and Enterprise Risk Manager are just examples of their approach to this philosophy. The Universal Rebalencer automated portfolio rebalancing which frees financial advisors from burdensome time, allowing the financial advisors to focus more on client relations. Meanwhile, Enterprise Risk Manager provides comprehensive analytics concerning risk within all asset classes, hence ensuring that the firms effectively and efficiently run their firms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Scheik, SoftPak has not only grown to become an expert in custom software development but also expanded its repertoire to include consultant placement and packaged software products.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Inspiration Behind Finding SoftPak Financial Systems</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naaz Scheik, a visionary in the financial technology space, founded SoftPak Financial Systems in 1994 with the mission to innovate and streamline portfolio management tools for greater efficiency.

Many grapple with outdated systems that hinder growth and complicate operations. Meet <strong>Nihan Yolga</strong>, <strong>Co-Founder</strong> and <strong>COO </strong>of <strong>Forceget Supply Chain Logistics</strong>, who is revolutionizing the logistics domain with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Forceget began its journey as an international logistics company focused on supporting eCommerce B2B sellers. However, Nihan and her co-founder, <em>Burak Yolga</em>, envisioned something greater from the start. They recognized the pressing need for a logistics provider that not only moved goods but also empowered businesses with complete oversight of their supply chain operations. This vision has materialized into a robust, AI-powered digital platform that transcends traditional logistics.</p>
<p>With a presence spanning four continents&mdash;North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, Forceget offers comprehensive end-to-end supply chain solutions. The platform integrates advanced management tools with logistics services, enabling businesses to streamline operations from one central hub. Features like Instant Quotes, Real-time Tracking, and Inventory Management simplify processes that once seemed daunting.</p>
<p>Nihan&rsquo;s commitment to innovation drives Forceget&rsquo;s mission to reshape the logistics industry. By harnessing AI technology, she ensures that businesses can make informed decisions and scale efficiently in a competitive marketplace. With tools designed for transparency and control, Forceget empowers customers to navigate market demands confidently. As she leads Forceget into the future, her vision continues to inspire a new era of logistics, one where complexity is simplified and businesses thrive through enhanced operational efficiency.</p>
<p><em>Let us learn more about her journey:</em></p>
<p><strong>The Vision</strong></p>
<p>The company, Forceget Supply Chain Logistics, is built upon the collective experience of its founders, Burak and Nihan Yolga. CEO and Co-Founder Burak spent seven magical years in China, where he fully confronted and immersed himself in the logistics world.</p>
<p>This exposure granted him a profound appreciation for the operating systems and threw light on inefficiencies that most businesses face while striving to deal with the intricacies of supply chains. Inspired by this experience, he ventured to design a solution that makes operations easy and allows companies to be more in control of their logistics systems.</p>
<p>The COO and Co-Founder Nihan has relevant industry experience due to her work experience for several years as the Head of Digital Innovation for Borusan Holding and applies that experience. She has such direct experience with what technology can do to traditional industries that she applies her knowledge in digitizing how logistics operations are conducted. They founded Forceget as an international logistics company providing air, ocean, and truck shipping services and a comprehensive supply chain solution provider.</p>
<p>Their mission was to bring in much-needed transparency into an industry that's often mysterious&mdash;an industry where customers have long been concerned about reduced visibility in their shipments and procedures. The platform by Forceget uses the most advanced AI and digital tools to integrate a comprehensive supply chain solution that gives businesses real-time visibility into every aspect of their logistics and inventory operations.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Burak and Nihan, Forceget continues to redefine industry standards. Indeed, a customer-centric solution like this one does not only bring complexity down but also grows more through the thorough nurturing of businesses in the midst of navigating the intricate world that is supply chain logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming Supply Chain Management</strong></p>
<p>Forceget's AI technology moves from reactionary action towards proactive data-informed strategies for supply chain management. It applies predictive modeling in sales trend forecasting and optimizes demand planning with pinpointed lead times. This way, clients avoid unnecessary stockouts, maintain lean inventories, and then help make running operations that are relatively streamlined and cost-effective while being focused on growth.</p>
<p>A lot of success stories in terms of Forceget AI technology are illustrations of its solid capabilities. The client was facing an inability to honor demand from its customers during peak seasons due to persistent stockouts. With the aid of the predictive tools at Forceget, it was able to analyze historical sales data to gain accurate knowledge of demand patterns. This foresight would allow the client to top up the right inventory levels just when it is needed and improve the overall stock levels of the client. Through such arrangements, they were able to eliminate stock outs while improving their fulfillment rate and exposing better customer satisfaction. This led to increased revenues.</p>
<p>Beyond just managing inventory, Forceget offers an AI-enabled pricing model, offering real-time quotations for air, ocean, and truck shipments. This function eliminates the lag involved in a business's decision-making process to render it agile enough to survive in the face of stiff competition.</p>
<p>The full force of technology from Forceget manages the edge of the supply chain&mdash;from forecasting to fulfillment&mdash;whisking along with smooth functionality, ensuring businesses operate at peak efficiency and effectiveness in today's fast-paced environment.</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Tracking Solutions for Modern Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Through strategic partnerships with key industry players, Forceget has established a reliable tracking system where smooth operations prevail with little hindrance. Initially, the focus lay in the development of a mighty platform that could unite all these transportation modes together: sea, air, truck, and small parcel shipments, hence fulfilling the promise of precise, real-time tracking of customers through the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The real-time shipment visibility gives not only the current status but also the changes in ETA and ETD. This feature further arms businesses with the power of informed decision-making, thus facilitating smooth operation. Therefore, by giving its customers real-time data accessibility, Forceget ensures that the customer is always in the know-how regarding the logistics process; the risk of uncertainty is reduced and the process becomes easier.</p>
<p>Emphasis on transparency and continuous tracking serves instead to strengthen the bond between Forceget and its clients, outfitting them with the information and control needed to aggressively expand without knowledge of an unexpected problem that would suddenly come barging into their business.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of the Customer Cockpit</strong></p>
<p>The "Customer Cockpit" is indeed a marvellous innovation of user experience, allowing clients to have a unified overview and complete control over their entire supply chain from one very easy-to-use interface. In this way, such a centralized system simplifies complicated logistics activities in that the users can easily trace shipments, monitor inventories, and receive instantaneous data without having to juggle through separate tools or systems.</p>
<p>Other than that, most clients are satisfied with what they have in place at the moment. Many have pointed out that, through the Customer Cockpit, they are now finally better structured and wasting less time in manual tasks&mdash;the overall efficiency therefore gets boosted. Navigation is user-friendly; users love it, and a whole lot of insights are available to them on the dashboard.</p>
<p>This empowerment no longer simplifies the workflow but frees them to concentrate on strategic growth initiatives rather than being mired in administrative duties. With the holistic solution, Forceget continues to improve the experience of logistics and promotes customers navigating this extremely competitive market with confidence and agility.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming Supply Chain Management with Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Forceget leads in the realm of supply chain optimization and puts advanced data analytics to work improving the operational efficacy of clients. For instance, it is about efficiency improvements by just eradicating inefficiencies and cost-cutting, which enable businesses to feel confident about navigating their supply chains.</p>
<p>Forceget applies AI-powered technology in examining large datasets thoroughly, hence extracting valuable trends for forecasting demand and also lead time evaluation. This predictive modeling enables the clients to estimate the velocity of sales so that they can maintain optimum inventory levels and avoid pitfalls of stockouts. By automating the replenishment and inventory management processes, Forceget is able to enable clients to avoid excess stock, holding costs, and lost sales due to inventories that could not meet demand.</p>
<p>One great innovation that has been executed by Forceget is the use of AI-based pricing models to give quotes for air, ocean, and truck in the shortest time possible. This basically eliminates wait times that would otherwise be spent, enabling a client to make swift, cost-effective decisions that further improve their operational efficiency.</p>
<p>By utilizing data analytics, Forceget identifies points of weakness for a supply chain and gives the client the insight to make choices that propel productivity. In the final instance, Forceget converts supply chain management into a strategic leverage point for businesses so that they can adapt their business model with ease in any landscape of rapidly changing markets.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging AI for Enhanced Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is going to revolutionize both supply chain management and logistics services through unprecedented levels of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. With AI-powered predictive analytics, organizations are now able to come up with the revolution of demand forecasting to enable real-time inventory management that largely reduces overstocking and stockout problems.</p>
<p>With AI automation in warehouses, the crucial processes of sorting, picking, and packing for order fulfillment are also faster and more accurate. At Forceget, on the forefront of this technological change, the team is a practically active user of AI to advance their platform for the users. They use sophisticated machine algorithms to analyze historically what has happened, seasonal trends, and conditions in the market to draw credible demand forecasts. This proactive strategy ensures optimal stock levels, reduces holding costs, and effectively mitigates the risk of stockouts.</p>
<p>Further, the pricing strategy of Forceget utilizes AI to update rates in real-time and as and when changes take place in demands and market dynamics. This would not only upgrade their service packaging but also make agility possible for their customers through navigating the very dynamically changed market. Thus, with these innovations, Forceget sets a new benchmark in logistics service and shows how smart applications in technology can lead to greater efficiency and agility in the supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>Elevating Efficiency in Warehousing</strong></p>
<p>Forceget realizes that the true operational strategy would be to have efficiency in warehousing. By site positioning of these facilities on both the east and west coasts, it puts the company in a better position competitively in the transport aspects. Geographical location aside from saving time in transit also saves the clients a lot since costs are dropped.</p>
<p>Forceget adopts a number of effective steps in making it more efficient within its warehouses. Advanced inventory management is the first step, involving the real-time tracking and organization of the stock. Quick retrieval to ensure that order needs are met produces timely satisfaction of the needs of customers. Checking on the level of inventory with a turnover rate is also addressed using data analytics to enable proactive replenishment and minimize excess stock.</p>
<p>Equally, the company's facilities are fitted with cutting-edge automation technologies that allow for the streamlining of sorting and packing. Through this technology integration, orders become fulfilled with a higher degree of both speed and accuracy, thus contributing to a more efficient operation in general. In such meticulous strategies, Forceget is continually perfecting its approach towards warehousing: always responsive to client needs, always operational excellence.</p>

<p>For decades, statins have been the go-to medications for managing high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing cardiovascular risk. While statins have proven benefits, they also carry potential side effects that some patients can't tolerate.</p>
<p>"We're transforming the treatment of cardiovascular disease for millions of patients," says Sheldon Koenig, President and CEO. &ldquo;In the battle against heart disease, the biotech <strong>Esperion </strong>is pioneering an innovative new approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esperion was founded in 2008 by Dr. Roger Newton, who had a pioneering idea&mdash;to develop a safe, effective cholesterol-lowering drug that didn't carry the negative side effects associated with standard statin medications. That concept gave rise to bempedoic acid, an ACLY inhibitor that gained FDA approval in 2020, for a subset of patients requiring additional LDL-C lowering</p>
<p>When Koenig took the helm at Esperion in 2021, the Company&rsquo;s clinical team was conducting a cardiovascular outcomes trial with bempedoic acid that was conducted in the midst of a global pandemic (COVID-19). Three years later, they achieved another milestone, securing FDA approval as the only non-statin oral LDL-C lowering medication for reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention patients. This vital indication addresses a significant unmet medical need, allowing Esperion to potentially help the millions of patients who cannot reach their goals on current therapies alone.</p>
<p>Esperion is focused on addressing all patients at risk for cardiovascular disease, including those often overlooked populations with few treatment alternatives. With its flagship product, bempedoic acid, now covering the full spectrum of cholesterol management and CV risk reduction, the company is well-positioned to make a seismic impact on global heart health.</p>
<p>And this is only the beginning. Esperion&rsquo;s employees remain focused on executing its commercial strategy while identifying other indications which its next generation ACLY inhibitors may be able to address.</p>
<p><em>Below are the interview highlights:</em></p>
<p><strong>Driven by Passion and Personal Experience</strong></p>
<p>Sheldon's career has been a lifelong pursuit fueled by a deep passion for bringing life-saving medicines to patients in need. With unwavering dedication, he has committed himself to the noble cause of bringing innovative therapies to market&mdash;therapies that possess the power to help patients and, quite literally, save lives.</p>
<p>His drive is not merely a professional calling, but a mission deeply rooted in personal experience.

His journey as a patient has instilled within him a profound appreciation for the tireless efforts of researchers, scientists, and medical professionals who tirelessly work to prevent and treat existing diseases.</p>
<p>Through his battle with cancer, Sheldon witnessed the transformative power of medical breakthroughs and the invaluable role they play in prolonging and improving the lives of countless individuals. This personal connection has only strengthened his resolve to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and the development of progressive treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting Cardiovascular Disease </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While cancer has rightly received significant attention, Esperion understands that cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer globally. This sobering reality reinforcess the Company&rsquo;s conviction that education plays a crucial role in empowering patients to take preventative measures and seek timely treatment.</p>
<p>Recognizing the transformative impact that accessible information and regular therapies can have on patient outcomes, the Company emphasizes the importance of patients being aware that cardiovascular events can often be prevented through simple steps, such as obtaining a lipid panel and adhering to a prescribed treatment regimen.</p>
<p>This belief in the power of education and preventative care has become a driving force behind Esperion, where the goal is to deliver innovative medicines that help patients achieve and maintain their health goals, both in the present and for the long-term future.</p>
<p>By emphasizing the significance of education and early intervention, Esperion aims to empower individuals to take control of their cardiovascular health, make informed decisions, and seek medical guidance before potentially life-threatening events occur.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Company&rsquo;s dedication to delivering innovative medicines underscores his belief in the power of scientific breakthroughs to advance treatment options and improve patient outcomes. Through the development of novel therapies, Esperion envisions a future where cardiovascular disease is not just managed but effectively prevented and, ultimately, conquered.</p>
<p><strong>The Lifesaving Impact of Cancidas</strong></p>
<p>In 1999/2000, Koenig played a pivotal role in the launch of Cancidas (Caspofungin Acetate) for Merck, a novel antifungal medication that would go on to save countless lives worldwide. This novel drug represented a significant breakthrough in the treatment of fungal infections, exhibiting no resistance and proving effective in treating both candidemia and aspergillosis in patients with compromised immune systems, including solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, and those living with HIV.</p>
<p>His involvement in the launch of Cancidas was an example of his dedication to bringing innovative and life-changing therapies to those in need. As he witnessed first-hand, this drug truly lived up to its life-saving potential, becoming a blockbuster success that contributed to the successful treatment of countless immunocompromised patients globally.</p>
<p>The significance of Cancidas cannot be overstated. Before its introduction, the medical community faced limited options for combating severe fungal infections, particularly in patients with weakened immune systems. These individuals were especially vulnerable to the devastating effects of such infections, often leading to life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>Cancidas represented a paradigm shift in antifungal therapy, offering a powerful and effective solution that could be tailored to the unique needs of these high-risk patient populations. Its ability to target and eradicate fungal infections without encountering resistance was a remarkable achievement, providing hope and relief to those battling these dangerous conditions.</p>

To remain at the forefront of this dynamic field, he proactively seeks out information from a diverse range of sources, including respected publications such as Endpoints and FiercePharma, as well as engaging with social media channels dedicated to healthcare discussions.</p>
<p>By embracing multiple platforms, he ensures that he has a comprehensive understanding of the latest breakthroughs, challenges, and trends shaping the cardiovascular space. This multifaceted approach allows him to stay informed about futuristic research, emerging therapies, regulatory developments, and the strategic initiatives of key players in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Health Care Practitioner Outreach and Patient Activation</strong></p>
<p>Regarding how Esperion might assist patients in achieving their health objectives, Esperion has embarked on a plan that includes physician education and patient activation.</p>
<p>The recent growth of Esperion's field sales force, coupled with the use of innovative digital tools, enables ~45,000 physicians (PCPs and Specialists) to gain awareness of these life saving medicines. This investment in education helps clinicians help their patients in controlling cholesterol levels and reducing their cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that patient activation is equally crucial in this endeavor, Esperion has launched a consumer campaign designed to encourage individuals to ask more questions regarding their cardiovascular well-being, specifically their risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event. This proactive approach aims to raise awareness and foster open dialogues between patients and their healthcare providers, empowering individuals to take an active role in their health journey.</p>
<p>The vision for Esperion extends beyond merely providing treatment options; it involves equipping both physicians and patients with the necessary tools and resources to facilitate informed discussions about cardiovascular health and enable collaborative efforts in setting and achieving treatment goals.</p>
<p><strong>Multifaceted Approach</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to address the challenges of managing high cholesterol and cardiovascular health, the Company has implemented a two-pronged approach that combines the strengths of a robust field force with innovative digital strategies. This multifaceted strategy reflects the company's adaptability and responsiveness to the evolving landscape in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The first prong of this approach involves a substantial expansion of Esperion's field presence. The company now has 150 territory managers actively engaged in the field, as well as a team of scientific liaisons who are experts in the cardiovascular space. This robust field force plays a crucial role in establishing direct connections with healthcare professionals, facilitating face-to-face interactions, and providing personalized support and education.</p>
<p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also catalyzed a significant shift in the way pharmaceutical companies approach marketing and physician engagement. Recognizing this change, Esperion has embraced digital strategies as the second prong of its approach, leveraging various digital channels such as emails, websites, and other online platforms to deliver promotional messages to physicians effectively.</p>
<p>This two-pronged approach acknowledges the importance of maintaining a strong physical presence through the field force while simultaneously adapting to the growing demand for digital engagement in the post-COVID era. By combining these two complementary strategies, Esperion aims to maximize its reach and effectiveness in communicating with healthcare professionals and delivering valuable information about its products and services.</p>
<p>Implementing this multifaceted approach underscores the Company&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and its willingness to adapt to evolving market conditions. By embracing both traditional field-based tactics and cutting-edge digital strategies, Esperion is positioning itself to meet the diverse needs and preferences of healthcare professionals, ensuring that its messaging and support can be delivered through multiple channels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Esperion's focus on measuring the success of these initiatives demonstrates a data-driven approach and a commitment to continuous improvement. By closely monitoring the effectiveness of its field force and digital strategies, the Company can make informed decisions, refine its tactics, and allocate resources effectively to achieve optimal results in promoting cardiovascular health and managing high cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Consumer Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the multifaceted strategies targeting healthcare professionals, Esperion's has undertaken a bold approach to engaging consumers directly by launching a robust consumer campaign targeting specific geographic regions, aiming to raise awareness and promote cardiovascular health among the general public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Esperion has forged a strategic partnership with RFK Racing, sponsoring both the #6 NEXLIZET&reg; (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) and #17 NEXLETOL&reg; (bempedoic acid) cars in the prestigious NASCAR&trade; Cup Series. This high-profile collaboration not only showcases the company's commitment to cardiovascular health but also provides a platform for reaching a vast audience of motorsports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Esperion will sponsor four NASCAR Cup races during the 2024 season, leveraging these prominent events to deliver accompanying programming and educational content on the importance of cardiovascular well-being. This innovative approach demonstrates the company's commitment to leveraging unconventional channels to disseminate vital health information and engage with a diverse range of individuals.</p>
<p>By combining targeted consumer campaigns with the excitement and popularity of NASCAR, Esperion is implementing a bold strategy that aims to capture the attention of the broader public. This approach recognizes the importance of reaching beyond traditional healthcare settings and embracing innovative avenues to promote cardiovascular health and raise awareness about the risks associated with conditions like high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Esperion's partnership with RFK Racing not only provides a platform for brand visibility but also serves as a powerful tool for connecting with audiences who may not traditionally engage with healthcare messaging. By aligning its brand with the thrill and passion of NASCAR, the company has the potential to resonate with individuals who may not have previously been receptive to traditional health campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Access and Advocating for Patient Choice</strong></p>
<p>The Company&rsquo;s devotion to ensuring widespread access to it&rsquo;s innovative cardiovascular medications is evident in the company's proactive approach to collaborating with both commercial and government payers. With the recent approval of its expanded labels, Esperion is actively working to broaden access to its therapies, enabling more patients to benefit from these potentially life-changing treatments.</p>
<p>Koenig&rsquo;s personal involvement in this endeavour underscores his commitment to the cause. He is not only guiding the strategy for engaging with payers but also taking his advocacy efforts directly to the field, speaking with prescribing physicians and payer management teams. This hands-on approach demonstrates his understanding of the importance of building strong relationships and open lines of communication with key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<p>Esperion&rsquo;s mission is driven by a fundamental belief that every patient should have the opportunity to access it&rsquo;s medicines if their physician deems it appropriate for their individual needs. This patient-centric philosophy recognizes the uniqueness of each individual's medical journey and the crucial role that healthcare providers play in determining the most suitable course of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Forging Partnerships for Improved Cardiovascular Care</strong></p>
<p>Esperion&rsquo;s commitment to advancing cardiovascular care extends beyond the Company&rsquo;s efforts, as evidenced by it&rsquo;s strategic partnerships with renowned organizations such as the Family Heart Foundation, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the American Heart Association (AHA). These collaborations reflect the belief in the power of collective action and&nbsp; understanding that addressing complex health challenges requires a multifaceted approach.</p>
<p>One notable example of Esperion's collaborative efforts is the recent partnership with the ACC, Amgen, and other companies on a program aimed at empowering patients to be more actively involved in monitoring their LDL-C levels. This initiative underscores the Company&rsquo;s recognition that patient education and engagement are crucial components in the fight against cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Despite being a small to mid-cap company, Esperion stands out for its rare ability to not only commercialize products like NEXLETOL and NEXLIZET while also looking to future opportunities for Esperion to help patients. This remarkable achievement is an example of his leadership, its employees, the company's strong financial management practices, and the unwavering "can-do" attitude that permeates the entire Esperion team.</p>
<p>Esperion&rsquo;s approach is characterized by a commitment to detailed annual goal-setting, ensuring that the Company remains focused and driven in its pursuit of excellence.

<p>Moreover, John's experience in building strong customer relationships and securing solid offtake agreements will be invaluable in Sinobec's efforts to establish a robust global sales force network. This will enable the company to better understand and respond to the evolving needs of its customers, further solidifying its position as a trusted provider of comprehensive metal solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Navigating Price Volatility and Minimizing Risk</strong></p>
<p>The metal industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, with commodity prices fluctuating widely and profit margins being squeezed as a result. Companies in this sector have had to adapt quickly to these changes in order to remain competitive and profitable.</p>
<p>One effective strategy that some metal companies have employed is exploring commodity hedge strategies with banks and consultants. By entering into derivative contracts at the time they pay their suppliers and take physical possession of the product, these companies are able to eliminate the effect of any price volatility up to the targeted time that the customer takes delivery of the product and a final invoice is issued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sinobec, for example, has implemented a hedging policy aimed at eliminating the effect of any volatility in the price of aluminum on its back-to-back sales. By taking this proactive approach, the company is able to minimize the impact of market price fluctuations on its bottom line.</p>
<p>In addition to hedging strategies, metal companies can also explore other ways to adapt to changes in the industry. This might include diversifying their product offerings, investing in new technologies to improve efficiency and productivity, or expanding into new markets.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to success in the metal industry is being able to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and implement strategies that mitigate risk and protect profit margins. By exploring options like commodity hedging and other innovative approaches, metal companies can position themselves for long-term success in an increasingly volatile and competitive landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Quality and Customer Value</strong></p>
<p>Sinobec, a leading company in its field, recognizes that quality is the foundation upon which its success is built. The organization not only prioritizes delivering high-quality products but also offers a range of value-added services to ensure customer satisfaction.

<p>The company understands that fulfilling customer value drivers is the essence of a thriving business. By consistently meeting and exceeding customer expectations, Sinobec has established itself as a trusted partner in the industry. The company's dedication to quality and customer-centric approach have been the driving forces behind its growth and success.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging the Recyclability of Aluminum</strong></p>
<p>Recycling aluminum can significantly enhance a company's market presence and sustainability efforts. By positioning the company as a leader in sustainability and developing innovative products that emphasize recycled aluminum content, businesses can differentiate themselves and attract environmentally conscious consumers.</p>
<p>From a sustainability perspective, recycling aluminum offers substantial benefits. It saves up to 95% of the energy required to produce new aluminum from raw materials, dramatically reducing the company's carbon footprint. Additionally, recycling aluminum conserves natural resources and mitigates the environmental impact of mining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, highlighting sustainability efforts and achievements in investor communications can attract investment, as many investors prioritize ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria. By demonstrating a strong commitment to sustainability through aluminum recycling, companies can strengthen their brand reputation and appeal to a growing segment of eco-conscious consumers and investors.</p>
<p>Overall, leveraging the recyclability of aluminum products can be a strategic move for companies seeking to enhance their market presence and contribute to a more sustainable future.</p>

This vision drives the innovative team at<strong> Fathom Health</strong>, a San Francisco-based company that's revolutionizing medical documentation through the power of artificial intelligence. In an era where healthcare professionals often find themselves drowning in administrative tasks, Fathom Health emerges as a beacon of hope, promising to alleviate the burden of paperwork and allow doctors to reclaim their time for what matters most - patient care.</p>
<p>Founded on the principle that technology should enhance rather than hinder the healthcare experience, Fathom Health has developed a cutting-edge AI system that's transforming the landscape of medical coding and documentation. Traditionally, these tasks have been labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Physicians frequently spend hours meticulously documenting patient encounters, often extending their workdays and contributing to the growing problem of burnout in the medical field.</p>
<p>Fathom Health's solution leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to automate and streamline the complex process of medical coding. By doing so, the company not only reduces the administrative workload on healthcare providers but also improves the accuracy and consistency of medical documentation.</p>
<p>The implications of this technology are far-reaching. With more accurate coding, healthcare organizations can ensure proper reimbursement for services rendered, reducing revenue loss due to coding errors. Moreover, the time saved on documentation allows healthcare providers to see more patients, potentially improving access to care in underserved communities.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most significant impact of Fathom Health's technology is on the quality of patient care. By freeing up physicians' time and mental energy, the AI system enables them to be more present and engaged during patient interactions. This could lead to improved diagnosis, more comprehensive treatment plans, and ultimately, better health outcomes.</p>
<p>As healthcare continues to evolve in the digital age, companies like Fathom Health are at the forefront, driving innovation that benefits both providers and patients. By harnessing the power of AI to tackle one of healthcare's most persistent challenges, Fathom Health is not just changing the way medical documentation is managed - it's reshaping the future of healthcare itself.</p>
<p>In a world where technology often seems to complicate rather than simplify our lives, Fathom Health stands out as a prime example of how AI can be harnessed to solve real-world problems and make a tangible difference in people's lives. As the company continues to grow and refine its technology, it's clear that the future of healthcare documentation is here - and it's powered by artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2><strong>Advanced AI Integration for Enhanced Medical Coding</strong></h2>
<p>Fathom Health's cutting-edge AI platform represents a sophisticated integration of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies. This platform excels in analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) and interpreting clinical notes with remarkable precision, transforming them into accurate medical codes.

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Investors and Strategic Partnerships</strong></h3>
<p>The funding round attracted major venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, DST Global, and SV Angel. Additionally, NFDG, an investment firm led by Nat Friedman and SSI&rsquo;s CEO Daniel Gross, also joined the round.</p>
<p>Gross highlighted the importance of collaborating with investors who align with SSI's mission. The goal is to advance towards safe superintelligence, with a focus on spending several years on research and development before introducing their product to the market.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>The Importance of AI Safety</strong></h3>
<p>AI safety has become a prominent issue due to concerns that advanced AI could potentially act against human interests or even pose existential risks. This has led to legislative efforts, such as a controversial bill in California aiming to enforce safety regulations on AI companies. The bill has generated significant debate within the industry, with some companies like OpenAI and Google opposing it, while others, such as Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI, support it.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Key Figures and Company Structure</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever"><strong>Ilya Sutskever</strong></a>, a notable figure in AI, co-founded SSI in June with Daniel Gross, who previously led AI initiatives at Apple, and Daniel Levy, a former OpenAI researcher. Sutskever serves as the chief scientist, Levy as the principal scientist, and Gross handles computing power and fundraising.</p>
<p>Sutskever&rsquo;s departure from OpenAI last year, following a dramatic boardroom conflict, led to his decision to start SSI.

<p><a href="https://www.seedworld.com/us/2024/03/27/positioning-investments-in-crispr-technologies-for-crops-of-the-future-what-we-heard-at-world-agri-tech/">Since 2012, </a>agriculture-related gene editing startups have secured over $2.7 billion in investments, marking significant progress in the field. However, like many sectors, these startups have felt the impact of the recent venture capital downturn. Despite this, the first half of 2024 is showing signs of a potential recovery, hinting at renewed investor confidence in the transformative potential of gene editing technology in agriculture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Investment Surge in 2024: A Positive Shift</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.agtechnavigator.com/Article/2024/04/29/Agtech-s-great-reset-continues-data-reveals">In the first half of 2024, </a>agriculture gene editing startups raised just over $161 million across six deals&mdash;a sharp increase compared to the $46 million raised during the same period in 2023. This surge represents a remarkable 206% year-over-year growth, even when excluding the $40 million deal that dominated the first half of 2024. The uptick in funding suggests that investors are regaining confidence in the sector's ability to innovate and deliver substantial returns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deal activity also saw a noticeable rise, with as many deals in the first half of 2024 as were recorded for the entirety of 2023. This is a strong indicator that the sector is regaining momentum. While it remains to be seen if 2024 will surpass the $241 million raised in 2022, the current trajectory is promising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Historical Context: The Road to Recovery</strong></p>
<p>To understand the significance of the recent investment trends, it's essential to look at the historical context. Investment in agricultural gene editing startups is still recovering from a post-COVID slump, with figures far below the pre-pandemic levels observed in 2018 and earlier. The only year with a lower investment figure than the present was 2017, which saw $58 million raised&mdash;a sharp dip following the $374 million spike in 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, investment activity in this sector has been relatively evenly distributed throughout the year. For instance, in 2022, the first half accounted for six out of twelve deals, a trend mirrored in 2021 and 2020. This balanced distribution suggests that 2024 is unlikely to experience the sharp decline in deal activity that characterized 2023, further supporting the narrative of a recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technological Advancements Drive Interest</strong></p>
<p>The resurgence in investment is driven by significant advancements in gene editing technology, which have dramatically improved precision and reduced costs. Startups like <a href="https://ohalo.com/">Ohalo Genetics</a> and Tropic are at the forefront of this innovation. Ohalo Genetics, for example, has developed "boosted breeding" technology that effectively prevents gene splitting in parent plants, while Tropic's gene editing-induced gene silencing (GEiGS) technology uses RNA interference to combat diseases and pathogens in crops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These technologies hold the potential to revolutionize agriculture by enabling the development of new crop varieties that outperform existing ones. Gene-edited crops can be engineered to resist pests and drought, adapt to previously inhospitable environments, and increase both yield and quality. This technological edge is a significant factor in the renewed investor interest in the sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory Landscape: A Double-Edged Sword</strong></p>
<p>One of the key advantages of gene editing over traditional genetic modification is that it doesn't introduce foreign DNA into crops, thus avoiding the "genetically modified organism" (GMO) classification in many regions. This regulatory distinction offers a significant advantage for seed companies, allowing them to enhance crops without triggering the stringent regulations associated with GMOs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the regulatory environment varies globally. In the European Union, gene-edited products are still regulated as GMOs, creating a less favorable environment for investment in the region. This discrepancy in regulation is reflected in the geographical distribution of funding, with the Americas dominating the industry at 81.9% of total funding ($2.23 billion), followed by Asia at 13% ($354.31 million), and Europe trailing at just 5% ($136.69 million).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, European institutions are beginning to recognize the importance of gene editing technology. In July 2024, the Ancient Environmental Genomics Initiative for Sustainability (AEGIS) received $85 million in funding, with $72 million coming from the Danish nonprofit Novo Nordisk Foundation and the remainder from the Wellcome Trust, a UK charity. This project aims to map the planetary genome using ancient DNA, which could serve as a foundation for developing new crop varieties based on evolutionary insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead: The Path to Sustained Growth</strong></p>
<p>The investment landscape in 2024 shows promising signs of recovery, particularly in the United States. The three largest funding rounds in the first half of the year were all secured by American companies. In January, Inari raised $103 million, Ohalo Genetics secured $40 million in a Series A deal, and BioConsortia raised $15 million in April.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While investment levels are still below pre-pandemic peaks, the resurgence in funding and deal activity suggests that the agriculture gene editing sector is on the path to sustained growth. With continued technological advancements and a more favorable regulatory environment in key regions, the future looks bright for this critical area of agricultural innovation.</p>1a9:T1618,<p>In a decisive move that underscores its ambition in the global remittance industry, <a href="https://sendsprint.com/">Sendsprint</a>, a UK-based fintech startup, has announced the acquisition of <a href="https://www.nobelfinancial.com/">Nobel Financial Inc</a>., a U.S.-based remittance company.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Google's submission, titled "Findings of Fact," provides a comprehensive overview of the search industry's evolution, highlighting Google's origins, innovations, competitive dynamics, and business strategies, including its lucrative search ads business and distribution agreements.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>A notable focus of the filing is on emerging web search startups like DuckDuckGo and Neeva. DuckDuckGo, a profitable entity since 2014, primarily relies on search advertising revenue, with a significant portion of its funding being allocated to shareholders rather than search engine improvements, according to Google's narrative. However, this assertion is countered by evidence suggesting DuckDuckGo's investment in search engine enhancement, albeit not at the scale desired by Google.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Despite DuckDuckGo's profitability, it lacks a comprehensive web index for organic search results, a fact highlighted by Google. Additionally, Apple's decision not to consider DuckDuckGo as a default search engine for Safari underscores the uphill battle faced by alternative search providers.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In terms of market penetration, DuckDuckGo commands a modest share of search queries globally and in Europe, indicating its limited competitive impact on Google's dominance.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Neeva, founded in 2019 by former Google executives, initially garnered attention for its ad-free search model. Despite raising substantial funding and leveraging advanced technologies like machine learning, Neeva struggled to gain traction in the highly competitive search market. While it attracted several million users at its peak, Neeva's consumer-oriented approach ultimately faltered, leading to a pivot to enterprise search and eventual acquisition by Snowflake.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The court filing also touches upon Yahoo's dwindling search business and highlights Google's argument that it competes not only with traditional search engines but also with specialized search services, AI platforms, and social media platforms.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Google's defense strategy aims to refute claims of monopoly by emphasizing competition from various search alternatives and broader digital services. However, the efficacy of this argument remains uncertain, given evidence of Google's significant market influence and tactics to maintain its dominant position, such as lucrative deals with Apple.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The ongoing trial underscores the complexities of the search market and the challenges faced by competitors seeking to disrupt Google's hegemony. While Google's market dominance is evident, the extent to which it constitutes anticompetitive behavior remains subject to legal interpretation, making the trial's outcome eagerly anticipated.</h4>1ae:Te47,<h4>Bilbao-based WIVI Vision is making waves in the field of visual health with its innovative approach to improving visual efficiency and treating visual dysfunctions.

Timur Davis, Investment Director at Munich Re Ventures, underscored the pivotal role of the SBIR program in offering crucial early-stage funding for nascent firms within the space industry. While these contracts can serve as a lifeline for many space entrepreneurs, Davis cautioned against the potential drawbacks they entail.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Davis highlighted the significant time and resource commitments associated with competing for SBIR contracts, which could inadvertently divert attention from essential commercialization efforts. He stressed the delicate balance between leveraging government support and maintaining a steadfast focus on product development and market entry strategies. Referring to the government's role as a "double-edged sword," Davis acknowledged the benefits it offers but also cautioned against potential pitfalls that could hinder a startup's growth trajectory. Thus, he advocated for a nuanced approach that carefully weighs the risks and rewards inherent in pursuing SBIR contracts.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Venture capitalists, who once championed commercial ventures above all else, have shifted their perspective as governments increasingly support space technology development, noted Timur Davis. Startups in the space sector cannot afford to overlook entities like NASA and the Space Force, which have become crucial sources of funding in recent years.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>While venture capital investment has declined, Davis highlighted the significant backing provided by governments, particularly in defense-related initiatives. This governmental support has created a favorable environment for space startups, contrasting with other industries experiencing greater financial challenges.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Davis emphasized the need for startups to guard against "scope creep," where projects funded by agencies like SBIR can veer off track, diverting attention and resources from core commercialization efforts. It's crucial for startups to strike a balance between pursuing government contracts for funding and staying focused on their long-term commercial objectives.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Davis cautions startups against excessive reliance on SBIRs, particularly if projects risk delaying product launches and losing ground to faster competitors. Advising prudence, he warns about the dangers of 'scope creep' and emphasizes the importance of understanding project commitments.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The SBIR program facilitates grants and contracts for small businesses to conduct R&amp;D on commercially applicable technologies. Additionally, government agencies utilize the STTR program, partnering with research institutions to fund small businesses.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>While applying for SBIR grants offers opportunities, Davis stresses the necessity of project delivery. He underscores the risk of diverting resources from essential commercial product development. Thus, while SBIRs provide vital initial funding, startups must navigate them judiciously to ensure alignment with long-term commercial goals.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>SBIR funding can inject up to $1 million in phases 1 and 2, providing crucial support for burgeoning firms. However, the transition to phase 3 and subsequent commercialization often presents hurdles. Despite these challenges, government technology investments remain indispensable for capital-intensive space sectors, with numerous recipients successfully leveraging SBIR to establish viable enterprises. Timur Davis underscores the critical importance of prioritizing core product development amidst the allure of government funding.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Moreover, Davis highlights the temporal disparity between project wins and funding availability, cautioning startups to anticipate delays. In the dynamic landscape of space technology entrepreneurship, every moment diverted from core objectives risks inefficiency. Hence, a conscientious approach to selecting and executing government contracts is paramount for startups seeking sustained growth and success.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>In some cases, SBIR awardees may find themselves in a situation involving what is termed as a "strategic funding increase" or STRATFI. These agreements entail the government committing to financing a project that also receives matching funds from private investors. For instance, a $20 million STRATFI would allocate a portion from SBIR funds, with the remainder sourced from other government agencies and venture capitalists (VCs).</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The enthusiasm surrounding such funding boosts can sometimes lead startups to prematurely celebrate their success. However, the reality often sets in when they realize that obtaining the entire $20 million entails a prolonged pursuit spanning two years, as they scramble to secure the remaining funds from various sources.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Mike Collett, the managing partner at Promus Ventures, emphasized the importance of understanding the intricacies of engaging with governmental entities. He noted that companies typically have a clear grasp of the protocols involved in working with the government.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Collett highlighted the remarkable transformation in funding opportunities for space tech startups, contrasting the current landscape with the limited options available just two decades ago. He stressed the indispensable role of government funding, emphasizing that, despite the availability of private capital, governmental support remains essential for the industry's growth.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Reflecting on the significance of government contracts, Collett expressed a preference for grappling with the challenges of managing a $10 million contract from NASA over the absence of such opportunities altogether. This sentiment underscores the vital role that government funding plays in facilitating the advancement of space technology startups, even amid a burgeoning private investment landscape.</h4>1b2:Tf6a,<h4>Amperesand, a leader in grid infrastructure solutions, is at the forefront of revolutionizing electrification with its innovative solid-state transformer (SST) technology.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While many industries can manage with generic ERP solutions, food manufacturers face unique challenges and requirements. From stringent regulations to complex supply chain management, the food industry demands a tailored approach. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This post delves into the critical features and considerations when searching for a food-specific ERP system.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Navigating the Regulatory Maze</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First and foremost, the food industry operates within a highly regulated environment. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) wields considerable authority over producing and distributing food products. Similar regulatory bodies exist worldwide, making compliance a global concern.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most significant regulatory shifts in recent years is the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011. This legislation gave the FDA unprecedented authority to oversee the entire food production cycle, from farm to fork. It strongly emphasizes improving food traceability, a feat often challenging without a food-specific ERP system.</span></p>
<h3><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Importance of Lot Traceability</span></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Under these regulations, businesses must establish and maintain detailed records for critical tracking events, encompassing growing, receiving, creating, transforming, and shipping. Much traceability is important, where records must track the origin, transformation, and creation of each food item.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These records can be either paper or electronic documentation, which is highly recommended due to the FDA's requirement for rapid accessibility. Electronic records facilitate swift responses to FDA requests, which could pertain to outbreaks, recalls, or threats to public health.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Averting Crisis: Food Recalls</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the world of food production, products are rarely static. Ingredients combine to form recipes, and these, in turn, create new products. Each component within a formula must be meticulously controlled, as any element could become the focus of a recall.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Food businesses require ERP systems that seamlessly manage and comply with recall regulations. Food safety is non-negotiable, and a robust system should track ingredients from inception to completion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It should also identify affected lot numbers and offer complete supply chain visibility. Some <strong><a title="advanced food ERP systems" href="https://icicletechnologies.com/">advanced food ERP systems</a></strong> even incorporate mock food recalls, allowing companies to test their recall procedures.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recipe Management: Precision and Efficiency</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Accurate inventory management and streamlined picking processes are integral to a food ERP system. They ensure that the precise lot of ingredients used in a recipe is recorded. However, recipe management extends beyond mere compliance; it plays a crucial role in unit-of-measurement conversions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Recipe management is indispensable for product labeling accuracy. Labels must faithfully represent ingredients, nutritional information, and allergens, regardless of the container size. ERP systems for the food industry encompass these functions, recognizing that processing can alter ingredient measurements.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Symphony of Batch Management</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Maintaining consistency across batches and locations is a core objective for any food business. Products' taste, texture, and aroma should remain constant to build customer loyalty. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Food ERP systems facilitate this through batch management, which allows the storage of quality measurements for each product recipe and finished item.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">These quality measurements comprise actual results and standards for batches. Moreover, ERP systems enable proportion management, ensuring that sets of varying sizes yield consistent outcomes. This is crucial because some ingredients require non-proportional quantities relative to others.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In conclusion, ERP recipe management ensures compliance with stringent regulations and fosters effective manufacturing schedules, cost management, and customer satisfaction. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The food industry's intricate dance between rules and consumer expectations requires a harmonious ERP solution to orchestrate success. If you're in the food manufacturing business, it's time to consider a food-specific ERP system as your trusted partner in navigating these challenges.</span></p>

<h3><strong>2. Beware of Phishing Scams</strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Phishing scams are a common avenue for online identity theft. These deceptive emails mimic trusted sources and aim to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Always exercise caution when opening emails, especially those requesting personal data. Mark suspicious emails as spam and, when in doubt, contact the organization directly to verify the email's legitimacy.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. Leverage Antivirus Software</strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Investing in robust antivirus software is a wise move to protect against identity theft. These programs offer multi-layered defense against various cyber threats. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Install antivirus software on all your devices, including laptops and smartphones, as online fraud knows no boundaries.</span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Monitor your Credit Reports and Financial Statements</strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Credit identity theft can significantly impact your financial health. Regularly review your credit reports from major bureaus like Equifax, Experian, and Million to stay vigilant. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Look for any unusual activities or unfamiliar accounts, and take immediate action if you detect unauthorized changes. Consider freezing your credit to prevent new credit lines from being opened without your consent. Monitoring your banking statements for unauthorized transactions is also vital.</span></p>
<h3><strong>5. Exercise Caution on Public Wi-Fi Networks</strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While public Wi-Fi networks provide convenient internet access, they need more security. Hackers can exploit these networks to access your data. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Use a <strong><a title="Virtual Private Network" href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/vpn-endpoint-security-clients/what-is-vpn.html">Virtual Private Network</a></strong> (VPN) to encrypt your online activities and maintain anonymity whenever possible. Save sensitive transactions and activities for secure networks.</span></p>
<h3><strong>6. Limit Oversharing on Social Media</strong></h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Social media platforms are a goldmine for identity thieves. Avoid oversharing personal information like your workplace, hometown, or email address, which can be used to answer security questions and gain access to your accounts. Review your privacy settings and limit public access to your profile.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What to Do If You're a Victim of Identity Fraud</span></h2>
<p><strong>Despite all precautions, identity theft can still happen. If you suspect your identity has been stolen, act promptly:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Change your account passwords.</li>
<li>Notify your bank or financial institutions immediately.</li>
<li>Request a copy of your credit report and look for unauthorized activity.</li>
<li>Lodge a notification through your country's cybersecurity authority.</li>
<li>Seek advice and support from organizations specializing in identity theft assistance, like IDCARE.</li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a digital age where personal information is currency, safeguarding your identity is paramount. By following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to identity theft and protect your online presence and financial well-being. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stay vigilant and proactive in the face of this evolving threat to ensure your identity remains secure in the digital landscape.</span></p>

Making the right choice between the two can be challenging, but this comprehensive breakdown will give you the insights to make an informed and confident decision.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Open-Source vs. Managed: Finding the Right Approach</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the most significant distinctions between DynamoDB and Cassandra lies in their management. DynamoDB is a fee-based, Amazon-managed product, whereas Cassandra is open-source and freely available for download. Opting for Cassandra gives you flexibility and freedom from being locked into the Amazon product ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, if you prefer additional support and ease of use, DynamoDB's managed approach might be more suitable. With this option, Amazon's professionals care for <a title="provisioning and scaling details" href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/aws-dynamodb-vs-apache-cassandra-comparing-the-two-nosql-databases/">provisioning and scaling details</a>, providing a hassle-free experience for decision-makers.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Before finalizing your decision, take a moment to weigh the pros and cons of the open-source and managed models. Assess your business needs to determine which product will seamlessly integrate with your operations.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data Security: Ensuring Confidentiality and Control</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DynamoDB and Cassandra offer excellent built-in data security features but differ in functionality. In Cassandra, users can define access privileges based on roles, allowing different access levels to specific data.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conversely, DynamoDB takes a different approach, where administrators assign specific privileges and access keys per user. This method offers more customization, benefiting large organizations or scenarios where other users require varying database access levels.</span></p>

<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Data Types: Structured vs. Unstructured Data</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consider the type of data your company handles before making a decision. DynamoDB is a centralized database best suited for storing structured data, while Cassandra is ideal for distributed systems and works well with unstructured data.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you plan for the future, contemplate whether your business will experience changes in data types. Being proactive about this can influence your decision on which database to choose.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Intended Uses: Aligning with Your Business Goals</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The intended use of the database is an essential factor to consider. For example, if your company frequently applies for grants, having a database like Cassandra can help with grant reports and meeting objectives. Such statements often have strict timelines, necessitating access to required data well before submission.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Even if your business isn't currently using databases, keep in mind that their adoption rates are expected to rise. Thus, selecting the right tool is crucial for preparedness.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scalability: Preparing for Growth</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Scalability is a critical aspect of any database choice. Both DynamoDB and Cassandra offer scalability, but they have different implementations.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cassandra allows seamless scaling up on demand, providing the required computing power and storage capacity to accommodate an organization's evolving needs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DynamoDB, being a managed service, also facilitates scalability, but it handles resource increases automatically on a serverless platform. While this relieves customers from taking the process themselves, it's essential to consider associated costs.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">User Support: Finding Assistance When Needed</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having access to reliable user support is vital for any business using databases. <a title="Cassandra has extensive documentation" href="https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html">Cassandra has extensive documentation</a> and a supportive community that can offer assistance when faced with challenges. However, as an open-source product, bug resolutions may take longer, though an active user base often leads to quicker fixes.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">DynamoDB, too, provides numerous resources, such as blog posts and webinars. Additionally, expert help is available for a fee, which may be worth considering based on your budget and specific use cases.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Getting the Best Outcomes: Taking the Time to Decide</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Choosing the correct database for your business requires time and dedication. Whether you decide on DynamoDB, Cassandra, or any other option, take ample time to evaluate your choices in the context of your company's current situation and future needs.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you've selected the database, allow sufficient time for all users to learn and familiarize themselves with the tool. This learning period is critical to ensure everyone can make the most out of the database and its features. By making a well-informed decision and investing in proper training, you set your business up for success in the long run.</span></p>

<p><em><strong>Also Read, <a title="Will Half the World to be Overweight by 2035 - What You Must Know" href="../startup-insights/will-half-world-overweight-by-2035-what-you-must-know">Will Half the World to be Overweight by 2035 - What You Must Know</a></strong></em></p>1bd:T20ab,<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being overweight and obese are two distinct health aspects, but the majority of people across the world know that both are similar things. Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal fat deposition that presents a health risk. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A body mass index over 25 is called overweight and over 30 is obese. BMI is a metric for measuring obesity and weight gain and defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. However, both are serious health risks and can even lead to an untimely death if not treated on time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the issue of being overweight, it is expected that over half of the <a title="World population" href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population"><strong>World population</strong></a> will go overweight or get obese by 2035 if current trends continue. According to the new report of the World Obesity Federation, obesity is rising at alarming rates, especially among adolescents and children. The most overweight countries in the world are Nauru, Palau, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, Niue, and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There would be a sharp steer from 2020 when 2.6 billion people or 38% of the world&rsquo;s population were classified obese or overweight.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity rates among adolescents and children could go 2X in the next 12 years. The percentage of young males having obesity could rise from 10% in 2020 to 20% in 2035 and it would rise from 8% to 18% in young obese females.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The global economic impact caused by being overweight or obese could reach $4.32 trillion annually by 2035 if preventive measures are not taken. As said if preventive steps are not taken the rate of obesity or overweight will increase across the globe and this could turn out to be a major health risk when such things can be controlled. </span></p>
<p><strong>Here are some examples:</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Obesity in Lower-income Areas</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity and overweight are likely to be high in low and lower-middle-income countries, whose healthcare infrastructure is not good enough to accommodate additional prevention and treatment efforts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Wajahat Mehal, Director of the Yale Metabolic Health and Weight Loss Program at Yale Medicine in Connecticut said, &ldquo;This is not a new trend, but to see that it is continuing and affecting children is very concerning,&rdquo;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The root prevention of obesity or being overweight is getting quality nutritious foods, Mehal said, but buying these fruits often is expensive or difficult to obtain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mehal explained, &ldquo;The main issue with nutrition is the ease of availability of calorie-dense processed foods, which are designed to give a quick reward without much ability to make us feel full and satisfied. The food environment is very unhealthy. Countries that have been successful in maintaining their traditional diets, such as Japan and Vietnam, have had a slower increase in obesity rates.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><strong>What Prompts Obesity to Impact Your Health?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factors that cause an increase in rates of obesity and overweight are complex, and their solutions have even more compositeness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Health experts that also include report authors suggest that telling people to eat healthier foods or fruits and get more exercise is nearly impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johanna Ralston, Chief Executive Officer of the <a title="World Obesity Federation" href="https://www.worldobesity.org/"><strong>World Obesity Federation</strong></a> put her views on this, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be clear: The economic impact of obesity is not the fault of individuals living with the disease. It is a result of high-level failures to provide the environmental, healthcare, food, and support systems that we all need to live happy, healthy lives.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity and other related health disorders are not just because of the lack of healthy foods available to eat, it also includes the increase of &ldquo;obesogenic pollutants&rdquo; in our environment and genetic predisposition as the driving factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, chemical pollutants have been seen with endocrine-affecting properties which also cause obesity and excessive weight gain. These chemical pollutants collectively called endocrine disruptors have been seen in cosmetics, food packaging, household furnishings, and roadside dust.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Climate Change Also Causes Obesity</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With climate change, it is said that global warming contributes to obesity. Environmental researchers have found that there is a clear and complex relaxation between global warming and getting obese. Global warming causes increased temperatures and this results in making people less physically active and also find difficulties in burning their body fat, all the while producing a higher carbon footprint.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from global warming, home appliances like microwaves also contribute to a small increase in BMI (Body Mass Index) and obesity. A study published in The British Journal of Nutrition in 2015 concluded that prepared meals, including &ldquo;heat-and-eat&rdquo; meals, were linked with not only worse overall dietary quality, comprising a low quantity of fibers in food and increased consumption of fats, but a broad range of surprising health effects.</span></p>
<h2><strong>What can be done to Curb Obesity?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's obesity in children or adults, there is always a health risk, and the treatment of overweight or obesity should either be controlled or treated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some measures to take-</span></p>
<h3><strong>Obesity Prevention for Kids</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obesity has no relation to age and it can happen to anyone. Prevention of obesity in kids starts at an early age-</span></p>
<h3><strong>Breastfeed Infants, Most of the Time if Possible</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has been found that breastfeeding helps in lowering the risk of obesity in infants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start giving healthy foods at a young age</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encourage your child to taste a variety of fruits at an early age. Not just fruits, but even vegetables and proteins would help get them the required amount of fiber and keep their digestive system healthy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>Obesity Prevention for Adults</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults are at more risk than children as they cannot be controlled like kids. Since their food habits vary, they more often grab &ldquo;bad food&rdquo; than &ldquo;good food&rdquo;. Eating healthy dietary fats can help adults keep their digestion strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adults should avoid sugary foods and processed foods as these foods are high in sugar, and fat that prompt overeating.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will half of the world be overweight is a vital question and should be a priority. There are multiple factors which have been mentioned here cause obesity and overweight to be riskier than ever. Some preventions have also been given which would help people avoid the risk of being overweight and obese.</span></p>

We are now approaching three years of hybrid and remote working, and organizations and individuals equally have had to adjust and strengthen their security infrastructures. And this push for more security talents will only grow stronger in the rest of 2023 in new and unique ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cybersecurity features have become an essential part of a company's infrastructure, and moving ahead by ignoring them is just next to impossible. Even though these features are present in a company's IT infrastructure, the present manpower is incompatible to stop or <a title="combat cyber attacks" href="https://www.cisa.gov/combating-cyber-crime"><strong>combat cyber attacks</strong></a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is worsening the productivity of companies and keeping them technically compromised. This concludes that a potential cybersecurity team can change the entire game for industries needing their presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the importance of cybersecurity manpower, and the growing requirement for advancements in cybersecurity, there is still a global gap of 3.4 million talents in the field. With 64% of global businesses have gone through at least one sort of cyberattack, the threat landscape continues to widen, and those who counter these attacks have never been more important. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our cybersecurity talents are the unsung heroes of the current generation who deserve more recognition. But instead of recognizing their potential, industries are facing the following challenges in hiring them-</span></p>
<h2><strong>Give Real &amp; Practical Hands-On Training</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, we need to start acknowledging the lack of the right cybersecurity talent as a current technical hiring challenge, and this will continue as we will have to encourage the younger generation to turn into cybersecurity professionals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growing need to combat cyber attacks, and the lack of required man force in the industry, proper cybersecurity education has become essential. Though more and more universities are creating cybersecurity courses, it still remains very small to the challenges industries are experiencing nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare young generations of cybersecurity talents to succeed, the courses must be developed based on the latest and probable cyber attacks. Along with the right courses, they must be given practical and real training in cybernetics instead of theoretical training.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, industries and businesses should also have to take ownership of this training. To make 2023 a cyber year for your businesses, as an employer, you have to give training to all employees on preventing and reducing cyber risk because it is really the best way to tackle the ever-growing cyber threat landscape. Every employee in a company plays a role even if it is to bring awareness of avoiding unsafe links and phishing emails.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Highlight Cybersecurity Work as Exciting and Diverse</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To also reduce the churn of cybersecurity employees, companies and universities should focus on the impact, uniqueness, and advantages of working within the industry. For instance, day-to-day cybersecurity tasks are different, so many diverse types of people will be able to enter this industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tasks should not be repetitive and employees due for this job should never be bored. The role of cybersecurity professionals is continuously evolving due to the increasing sophistication of attackers and constant creativity, and this is an important factor when looking for a job. Promoting these most prominent work qualities will be vital as the industry looks for the effective development of its own workforce to protect against threats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, companies should keep supporting their cybersecurity teams. Having the right talented and motivated team helps employees feel empowered, excited, and reassured about their careers. As leaders and organizations, we are responsible for building safe environments for our employees.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Empower Team with Modern-Day Cybersecurity Applications</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As said above, keeping the work profile of cybersecurity professionals diverse is crucial as it helps them stay motivated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only should work profiles be diverse but also companies need to provide a state-of-the-art cybersecurity department where the latest desktops would be available. Many organizations which are equipped with potential cybersecurity applications have saved their data and necessary documents from being hacked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lack of appropriate cybersecurity applications is with mid and small-size businesses. These companies don&rsquo;t have an ample budget to fix this issue and thus have to compromise here. This is a check time for large to small businesses as avoiding these necessary technical requirements won&rsquo;t be right for the future of their companies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, companies should get a fixed budget for their cybersecurity applications so that they can stay safe and ahead in the competition of acquiring the right technology.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Refurbish Your Hiring Processes and Rethink Selection Criteria</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Companies should have a fixed number of non-negotiable criteria for applying candidates such as work experience, and exposure to the <a title="latest cybersecurity technologies" href="https://www.cyberdegrees.org/resources/hot-technologies-cyber-security/"><strong>latest cybersecurity technologies</strong></a>. Although in a competitive market like cybersecurity, it is worth revamping these criteria and keeping them flexible as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Businesses seeking talented people should revamp their hiring procedures to make them streamlined and speedy. The tech hiring market is competitive, and the cybersecurity workforce market with the current talent gap is even more. Streamlined procedures and reaching fast aspirants through the entire procedure will be vital to the closure of candidates for companies.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Underrated Work Profile</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though there is a huge need for cybersecurity professionals, a lack of the right education, and the increasing importance of cybersecurity applications to companies, the job profile is still underrated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like cybersecurity, there are multiple technologies evolving at the same time, but being one of the most required technologies, it&rsquo;s still difficult to get a single cybersecurity professional.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exposure to the industry is indeed a requirement, and everyone concerned with the industry needs to play their role. Be it companies, creators of cybersecurity professionals, universities, or aspirants, everyone has to contribute.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the growing demand for cybersecurity professionals, it&rsquo;s high time to rethink the hiring process. If universities bring quality courses, the right candidate will be delivered. When the right candidate enters a company, he/she can better improvise the infrastructure and keep the company's data safe and secure. Along with this, companies should also invest in innovative and modern-day cybersecurity applications for their data protection.</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Also Read, <a title="Wall Street's Six Big Banks Earn $1 Trillion Profit in a Decade - America&rsquo;s Financial Makeover" href="../startup-insights/wall-street-six-banks-earn-1-trillion-in-decade">Wall Street's Six Big Banks Earn $1 Trillion Profit in a Decade - America&rsquo;s Financial Makeover</a></strong></em></p>1bf:T1c7b,<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the first time ever, the six banking giants of US banking will see a trillion decade, and it's not the revenue, it's pure profit. These six banks are JP Morgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs, and others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street which has been the official flag bearer of wealth in the U.S. was given a setback when these banking giants came up and were raring to score such a massive profit. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is said that Wall Street was the major source behind the financial crisis in America and didn&rsquo;t want banking organizations to lead the wealth spectrum of the country.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Why was Wall Street A Target of the Global Protest Movement?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the decade began, Wall Street was the target of a global protest movement, and politicians on both sides of the political spectrum were fuming over bailouts or attempting to break up too-big-to-fail lenders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While most of the world's attention was focused on the wealth generated by Silicon Valley, banks were gathering steam. Volatility boosted Wall Street's trading hauls, investment bankers decided to ride a dealmaking boom, and then US President Donald Trump boosted bottom lines by lowering taxes. Likewise, there are multiple reactions to the milestone across the industry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is not just the profit scale that is so astonishing, though there is much more than this like the industry&rsquo;s capability to push through scams and thrive anew.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Paying for Scandals</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks had to pay in order to escape the shadow of the global crisis. In 2014, Bank of America agreed to a US$16.7 billion settlement to end investigations into shoddy mortgage practices, surpassing JPMorgan's US$13 billion. By then, some banks had discovered new sources of profit, which had landed them in hot water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employees at Wells Fargo, under pressure to meet sales targets, opened millions of accounts for customers who had not requested them, the most well-known of a series of scandals that eventually spanned the majority of the company's businesses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Malaysia, <a title="Goldman Sachs" href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/"><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong></a> finished raising billions of dollars in 2013 for the 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state-owned investment fund that was then stolen by a group led by a former prime minister.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That year saw a new level of fervor on Wall Street. Banks that made less than US $70 billion in 2017 made more than US 120 billion in 2018 as a result of tax cuts, an increase in interest rates, and increases in retail banking and dealmaking.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The period was a wild ride for bankers. Personnel costs for the six companies, which had been hovering around US $148 billion at the start of the decade before dropping for a few years, jumped to US $154 billion in 2019, despite the fact that their overall employee count had actually decreased. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's already-billionaire CEO, would eventually receive such a large pay package that a proxy advisory firm advised shareholders to vote against it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analysts were attempting to write obituaries for Wall Street's run of record profits in early 2020. Instead, banks aided in the proliferation of blank-check businesses known as special-purpose acquisition companies. Later, when regulators became concerned and prices began to fall, investors were left holding the bag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Profits in 2021 were also boosted by an accounting move: banks felt confident enough in the economy, thanks to government interference, to unleash some of the reserves they had reserved in case loans went bad. The Big Six made more money in 2021 than in 2013 and 2014. Even when Russia attacked Ukraine this year, the turmoil aided traders in defying expectations of hard times.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after accounting for inflation and large bank amalgamations during the financial crisis, profits over the last ten years have surpassed those of the previous decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Others, particularly in Silicon Valley, have done far too well for Wall Street to claim a monopoly on success. Apple alone earned more than $500 billion. <a title="JPMorgan" href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/"><strong>JPMorgan</strong></a> was beaten by Microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, and Alphabet, with Exxon Mobil edging out Bank of America and Wells Fargo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banks would credit some of their gains to innovation after investing in tech platforms and improving offerings such as credit card rewards. They have also assisted companies in accessing capital markets in order to grow the economy, and they have retained some of the profit, contributing more than US $200 billion to their capital buffers in the past decade to reduce the likelihood of a repeat of 2008.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, it was another government involvement that kept the economy afloat during the pandemic, paving the way for those record profits. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some banks have concentrated their efforts on a narrower set of customers, limiting opportunities for many communities, and have been slow to pass on rate increases to savers, betting that customers will not flee to smaller competitors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><strong>How does the Market Move from Here?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Critics would counter that this achievement of gaining $ 1 Trillion is not just the credit of banks alone. Many banks would have not been able to cope if it weren&rsquo;t for taxpayer aid, and those buffers resulted from strict capital rules, sometimes ratified over bankers&rsquo; objections.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the intervention of the government, any financial reform is next to impossible. Critics also say the fortunes of banks also depend on the health of clients. If the clients are growing slowly or at a fast pace, the bank would take no time to make massive profits.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These six banking giants are extremely capable of doing unbelievable things as they are the strongest pillars of the financial system of America. They can make the country proud of being a developed nation always.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since then the use of both web products i.e. the search engine and the browser has been immense. The search engine and browser became even more popular when Google introduced Google Chrome and Microsoft launched Bing, its specific web browser.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Microsoft, the tech giant based in the US, has plans to reinvent its search engine and browser at the same time with the help of artificial intelligence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tech company with the vision to empower its users to unlock the joy of discovery &amp; feel the wonder of creation transforms its search engine and the browser to make people experience the new avatar of both web products.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI-powered Bing search engine and Edge browser are available at <a title="Bing.com" href="https://www.bing.com/"><strong>Bing.com</strong></a>, and these tools act as an AI copilot for the web.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>The new Bing and Edge &ndash; Your Copilot for the Web</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have brought together search, browsing, and chat into one unified experience you can invoke from anywhere on the web, delivering:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft has brought browsing, searching, and chatting into one unified experience you can cite from anywhere on the internet. They deliver-</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Better Search - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI-powered Bing offers an enhanced version of the familiar search experience, bringing more relevant answers for a wide range of queries as well as a new sidebar that displays more comprehensive answers if you want them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>In-Depth Answers - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new search engine searches the web for results and summarises them to find and summarise the answer you're looking for. For example, instead of scrolling through multiple results, you can get detailed instructions on how to check the real price and latest model of Lamborghini cars.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>A New-Age chat Experience -</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The new Bing search engine provides an interactive chat option for more complex search queries, like researching what TV to buy or planning a detailed trip to Thailand. The chatbot enables you to keep refining your search until you reach the complete answer by asking for more details, ideas, and clarity. You can do this with links available to support your decisions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>A Creative Spark - </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">While searching, many times you look for more than an answer- you need inspiration. The new Bing search engine is able to generate the content that is most specific to your query. The search engine allows you to prepare for a job interview, write an email or create a 5-day itinerary for a dream vacation to Bangkok. The new Bing also authorizes its sources, so you&rsquo;re able to see links to the web content it references.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Microsoft and OpenAI &ndash; Together for Responsible Innovation</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft in association with OpenAI is intended to implement security measures to protect users against harmful content. The respective teams are working on identifying issues like content blocking, data safety, misinformation, and disinformation, and preventing the promotion of discriminatory content in line with its AI principles.</span></p>
<h4><strong>Google Bard</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like Microsoft, Google also launched its artificial intelligence-driven chatbot, Bard, apparently combating the supremacy created by ChatGPT.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft backed ChatGPT, a unique invention of OpenAI, though still at the prototype stage when released last November. The software has garnered attention for its capability to engage in significant and engaging &lsquo;conversations&rsquo; with the general enquirer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google jumping into the war of AI-driven chatbots has tried to prove its availability of the latest technology. Since Chrome is one of the most used search engines across the world, it has high hopes from Bard. So, let&rsquo;s move to know-</span></p>
<h2><strong>What is Google Bard?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to ChatGPT, Bard is also a conversational AI chatbot that responds to text-based queries in a conversational format. The chatbot helps write an essay, provides travel planning advice, guides on creating business models and making marketing strategies, and does many more things that users of Google look for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Language Model for Dialogue Applications (<a title="LaMDA" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/"><strong>LaMDA</strong></a>) of Google which has been under development for many years empowers the AI chatbot, Bard. It offers responses by using information collected from the internet.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Features of Google Bard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">LaMDA, a new language model that Google developed for several years, happens to be the engine of Google Bard. Its comprehensive language models intelligence, creativity, and power are merged with the breadth of the world's knowledge. Then Bard utilizes the data from the internet to give original and excellent responses.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What does Google Bard do?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collects data from the internet to offer a summary of high-quality responses</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Concludes developments in recent scientific discoveries</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eases the way for skill development for users</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Streamlines complex subjects and provides articulate responses for the enquirer&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How to Access Google Bard?</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Bard is still in its trial phases and can only be accessed by a small number of users for evaluation. It is currently not available to the general public. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google will take external feedback with its internal testing into consideration before ensuring responses of Bard meet a high bar for quality and safety in the real world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Limitations of Google Bard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversational AI and chatbots have basically changed the use and development of computer software, and also have the capability to reorganize digital assistants, email programs, and search engines. However, Bard faces some drawbacks in this space.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Google Bard</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bard is able to provide crucial information that includes crisis support and identify key moments in videos with help of its advanced and multilingual understanding of information.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PaLM, Imagen, LaMDA, and MusicLM are completely enabling people to interact with information by combining audio with video, language, and images.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The AI chatbot war is getting aggressive every day, and it was initiated with the launch of the revolutionary ChatGPT, the conversational chatbot of OpenAI. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now Microsoft and Google have jumped into the war and come up with the New Bing &amp; Edge browser, and Google Bard, respectively. It would be interesting to see how this competition moves forward. We can expect more companies to bring their unique approach and invention to make AI chatbots and conversational AI better than ever.</span></p>

You&rsquo;re not being paranoid if strangers really are snooping for your sensitive online information. There&rsquo;s a good reason for wanting to shield your location and personal data from prying eyes and nosy corporations, especially since the U.S. government now allows your ISP to sell anonymized user data to third parties. A virtual private network or VPN can put a stop to that nefarious activity by letting you camouflage yourself on the internet. A VPN lets your data flow through an encrypted tunnel to a VPN server, so anyone monitoring your connection sees unintelligible data &mdash; the VPN server&rsquo;s IP address instead of your device.</p>
<p>However, not all Android VPN apps are of equal quality and trustworthiness. In choosing a VPN, consider the business models of VPN companies, especially those offering their services for free. Make sure you understand their privacy policies before signing on. We&rsquo;ve identified all the options for the best VPN for Android you can install today, and all of them support the OpenVPN protocol &mdash; the most secure option for Android. Our list of 5 best Android VPN will help you choose the perfect one for you.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><br />1. <a href="https://nordvpn.com/bundle-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NordVPN</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first to be on the list of best Android VPN is NordVPN. NordVPN has been our favorite virtual private network for years running, so it should come as no huge surprise that it&rsquo;s also one of the best VPNs for Android. NordVPN operates more than 5,000 servers in 60 countries across the globe and provides excellent connection speeds, reliability, good compatibility with streaming services like Netflix, and ease of use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based in Panama, NordVPN also keeps a strict no-logs policy and allows you to connect up to six devices at the same time. The virtual private network has another great feature known as split tunneling, which lets you pick and choose which connections, devices, and/or apps you want to use on the VPN and which you&rsquo;d rather keep on the clearnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with Android devices, NordVPN works with Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, VPN routers, and select smart TVs. Pricing starts at $4 per month if you opt to pay for the two-year plan, and there&rsquo;s a 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>
<h2><br />2. <a href="https://surfshark.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surfshark</a></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next to be on the list of best Android VPN is Surfshark. Surfshark is a great VPN if you&rsquo;re looking for something fast and effective. It has a one-click VPN feature, or you can choose from 3,200 servers in 65 countries or if you&rsquo;re looking to bounce through a specific country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can whitelist specific apps or websites, if you&rsquo;re not too worried about being tracked by those, which allows them a small speed boost &mdash; and there&rsquo;s even an emergency fail-safe built in, so it automatically disconnects you if the VPN connection drops. There&rsquo;s a free seven-day trial, but after that, you can pay for two years upfront at $60, six months for $39, or monthly for $13 &mdash; the best value is the two-year plan. However, there&rsquo;s also a 30-day money-back guarantee if you don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. ProtonVPN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Created by Swiss-based CERN scientists &mdash; the company that created ProtonMail, the encrypted email service &mdash; the free version of ProtonVPN will not record browsing history, display privacy-invading ads, sell private data to third parties, or limit your downloads. Instead, it encrypts your data using AES-256 and 4096 RSA, and thus cannot share your data with anyone. ProtonVPN supports two secure VPN protocols &mdash; IKEv2/IPSec and OpenVPN &mdash; and encrypts your DNS so that your browsing cannot be found via DNS queries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also features split-tunnel support, letting you choose which traffic flows through the VPN, and a kill switch to guard against disconnects. Free users can only connect one device to free servers in Japan, the Netherlands, or the U.S., while paid subscribers can access 1,000 high-speed servers in 50 countries, and access blocked or censored content and stream videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paid versions &mdash; which cost $48 (Basic) or $96 per year (Plus) &mdash; support a range of features like file sharing, BitTorrent, and Tor over VPN, and the ability to connect two and five devices at a time, respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. VyprVPN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VyprVPN has a solid track record for online privacy and security. It owns and runs its own networks independent of third parties, doesn&rsquo;t share your data with anyone, and only keeps logs of IP addresses, connection times, and bytes used for 30 days. It&rsquo;s got a huge worldwide reach of 700 servers and 200,000+ IPs spanning 70 countries and 6 continents. It supports 256-bit encryption, allowing you to freely browse from anywhere. It all happens via the proprietary Chameleon technology, which masks the VPN service, especially if you want to stream content from a different country and bypass censorship and other restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VyprVPN lets you configure the app to automatically connect based on your preferences &mdash; such as any time you join an untrustworthy network. Test drive the service with a free, three-day, ad-free trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. ExpressVPN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ExpressVPN offers a choice of more than 3,000 VPN servers in 160 locations and 94 countries featuring unlimited speed and bandwidth for downloading or streaming. The service works with Wi-Fi, LTE/4G, 3G, and all mobile data carriers, and touts 24/7 customer support, along with support for encryption via OpenVPN, UDP, and TCP protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app does not log traffic data or browsing activity, and its kill switch network protection halts internet traffic if the VPN can&rsquo;t connect &mdash; for Android 8.0 Oreo or higher. The app also facilitates split tunneling, allowing you to route some device traffic through the VPN, while the rest accesses the internet directly. You can try ExpressVPN free for seven days. After that, you&rsquo;re looking at $13 per month, $60 for six months, or $100 per year.</p>
<p>This concludes our list of the 5 best android VPN that you can definitely try put in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Are you keen to learn more interesting facts about Steve Jobs? Don&rsquo;t worry for you&rsquo;re in the right place!</em></strong></p>
<p>The tech genius and the man behind globalizing Apple, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steve Jobs</a></strong>, is a familiar face on the internet. Despite his demise years ago, he continues to be the tech giant. In fact, Jobs is considered as the genius who revolutionized modern technology and the mastermind who emphasized style as much as function in our everyday digital devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite being a familiar and an open book, there are several facts about Steve Jobs that are unknown to a vast majority of the people. Therefore, in this blog, we have compiled 40 unique yet intriguing facts about Steve Jobs that will take you by surprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Steve Jobs was, biologically, half Arab. His biological father was Syrian and his mother was American.</li>
<li>His biological parents had one mandate--that Jobs be adopted by two college-educated people. The biological parents found out that neither Clara nor Paul Jobs had ever graduated from college, but the adoption went through when it was promised that Steve Jobs would receive a university education (funny considering that Jobs went on to become a college dropout).</li>
<li>Jobs was a pescetarian, meaning he ate no meat except for fish.</li>
<li>One class Jobs audited was a calligraphy course, which he says was instrumental in the future Apple products' attention to typography and font.</li>
<li>While unofficially attending classes, Jobs struggled to get by. He slept on his friends' dorm room floors, returned Coke bottles for money, and survived off free meals from the local Hare Krishna temple.</li>
<li>He had a pretty low GPA--just 2.65. Jobs admitted he never enjoyed school structure and preferred to learn in unconventional ways.</li>
<li>He spent seven months traveling around India, experimenting with psychedelic drugs and eventually adopting the practices of Zen Buddhism.</li>
<li>Jobs has called experimenting with LSD as "one of the two or three most important things I have done in my life."</li>
<li>Jobs stole from partner and co-founder of Apple Steve Wozniak. When the pair first created the Breakout game for Atari, they planned on splitting the pay 50-50. Although Atari gave Jobs $5,000 for the game, Jobs told Wozniak they got $700, leaving Wozniak to take home $350 while Jobs pocketed the other $4,650.</li>
<li>Jobs was moved to the night shift when working at Atari due to complaints about his hygiene. He rarely showered and would walk around barefoot in the Atari offices.</li>
<li>There was actually a third founder of Apple--Ronald Wayne, who even designed Apple's first logo. Wayne sold his 10 percent stake just two weeks after partnering with Jobs and Wozniak for only $800 (talk about regrets).</li>
<li>The original Apple I computer was priced at $666.66. Don't worry, there was no devil worshipping going on--Jobs and Wozniak just wanted the Apple I to cost one-third more than wholesale ($500).</li>
<li>Jobs was pushed out of his own company in 1985. Despite the fallout, he later recognized the coup as a blessing in disguise, as it gave him a chance to experiment creatively and purchase an animation studio, which would later be known as Pixar. Eventually he rejoined Apple as CEO in 1997 (and revitalized the failing company).</li>
<li>Shortly after being shooed out of Apple, Jobs applied to fly on the Space Shuttle as a civilian astronaut (he was rejected) and even considered starting a computer company in the Soviet Union.</li>
<li>Jobs had an illegitimate child, Lisa Brennan, when he was 23, whose paternity he denied for years. Lisa's mother had to use welfare checks to raise her child. Eventually, Jobs did accept Lisa as his legitimate child, and she changed her name to Lisa Brennan-Jobs.</li>
<li>Despite initially denying paternity, around the time Lisa was born, Jobs named a new Apple computer the Apple Lisa (although Jobs claimed it simply stood for Local Integrated Software Architecture).</li>
<li>While at Apple, Jobs always kept his annual salary at $1. Don't worry, with 5.5 million shares of Apple stock and as the majority shareholder of Disney stock (from selling Pixar), he wasn't quite what you'd call a starving artist.</li>
<li>Jobs ended up connecting later in life with his biological sister, Mona Simpson, whom he grew very close with. Both were naturally artistic and shared much in common.</li>
<li>The movie Anywhere But Here is based on a book written by Jobs's sister, Mona Simpson. The movie is dedicated to Jobs.</li>
<li>Jobs was no philanthropist. In fact, in Apple's early days, he cut the company's philanthropic programs, saying they would return when the company was more profitable. Despite Apple's enormous success, the charitable programs were never reinstated.</li>
<li>Jobs had an entire team devoted to packaging who studied the experience of opening a box to learn how to achieve the excitement and emotional response that is now common with Apple products.</li>
<li>A well-known egomaniac, Jobs was infamous for being difficult and demanding. In 1993, he held a spot on Fortune's list of America's Toughest Bosses.</li>
<li>Jobs was not always friendly with journalists and the media, wanting to retain total control of Apple's impression on the public. Apple even sued teenager Nicholas Ciarelli for his Think Secret blog, where he revealed rumors and secret details about upcoming Apple products.</li>
<li>Jobs is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor for 346 United States patents related to a range of technologies, with most of the patents being for design.</li>
<li>Jobs had romantic relationships with Joan Baez and Diane Keaton.</li>
<li>Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak notes that Jobs never learned how to code.</li>
<li>Bill Clinton once invited Jobs to spend the night sleeping in the Lincoln bedroom of the White House.</li>
<li>Apple has been ranked No. 1 on Fortune's list of America's most admired companies.</li>
<li>Jobs harbored an intense dislike for PCs, and is quoted as saying to one friend, "I'd rather sell dog shit than PCs."</li>
<li>He never put license plates on his silver Mercedes (despite driving it constantly). How did he do it? California has a rule that a car owner has six months to put plates on a new car. Jobs just changed cars (to the identical model) every six months, allowing him to drive without plates.</li>
<li>Jobs often parked in spots reserved for the handicapped.</li>
<li>Jobs originally did not want to offer his products in white, but he was swayed after being introduced to the "moon gray" shade. Pretty surprising considering the iconic clean, white look of Apple products today.</li>
<li>Jobs actually served as a mentor for Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, even sharing some of his advisers with the Google duo.</li>
<li>Jobs was furious when Google created its Android devices, entering as an Apple competitor in the phone market.</li>
<li>Jobs was found to have pancreatic cancer in 2003, but rather than taking the doctor-recommended path of immediate operation, Jobs subscribed to an alternative-medicine regimen, including a vegan diet, acupuncture, and herbal remedies, even consulting a psychic.</li>
<li>After nine months, Jobs gave in and underwent surgery. Many consider the delay a major factor in his eventual decline.</li>
<li>Apple, Microsoft, and Disney properties (including Disneyland and Disney World) flew their flags at half-staff when Jobs died.</li>
<li>His last words on his deathbed were, "Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow," while gazing over his family's shoulders.</li>
<li>Tim Cook revealed in a 2014 interview that Jobs's main office and nameplate are still as they were in 2011, when Jobs passed away.</li>
<li>Sunday, October 16, 2011, was declared Steve Jobs Day by the governor of California, Jerry Brown.</li>

In the strive to be ahead in the race, major companies are incorporating latest business strategies for optimum results. In this blog, we will discuss what exactly a business strategy is and why it is vital for businesses (big or small).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating a business strategy is not a cakewalk. The strategy should align with the organizational vision as well as its mission. Moreover, creating a business strategy for long-term success takes time and development. Therefore, we will also discuss the components of a business strategy to help you generate ideas for your own business, irrespective of its size.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So, what is a business strategy?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A business strategy is a powerful tool for helping you reach your business goals, defining the methods and tactics you need to take within your company. The business strategy also guides many of your organizational decisions, such as hiring new employees.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Generating specific business strategies is an absolute necessity to increase the odds of success. Its importance quickly becomes imperative over the course of time. Moreover, several business owners tend to seek or hire outside consultants to assist with forming and carrying out strategies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In laymen, business strategy is the collective term for all the steps a company takes to reach its goals and achieve its mission and vision. It involves understanding what the business does, what it needs to have, and what it needs to do to reach those goals. That information drives decisions about how to allocate resources, both human and material. The strategy also helps set priorities when resources aren&rsquo;t available to do everything at once.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When everyone within the organization understands the strategy, it creates a framework to keep everyone working in the same direction. Though it is critically important to any business that wants to survive and thrive, business strategy is just one component. The business strategy definition is different from the company&rsquo;s mission. The mission is what management wants the business to accomplish, while strategy is how it will achieve that mission. The company strategy is also different from business relationships with customers, employees, vendors, and others that create value within the economy. A strategy is also not the vision, which is a picture of what the world would look like if it truly achieved the mission.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why business strategy is vital?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A business strategy paves way for the success of a business by aligning its operations with its vision and mission. However, there are several other reasons that define the importance of a business strategy:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Business strategy helps identify the key steps for reaching your business goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Creating a business strategy allows to identify and evaluate the company&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses for further developing a strategy that optimizes strengths and compensates for weaknesses.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>It also allows effective allocation of resources for business activities that automatically increases efficiency. Moreover, implementation of a business strategy allows planning for activities deadlines, job roles, and staying on track with project goals.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Creating a business strategy gives more control over choosing the kinds of activities that will directly help reach goals while easily assessing closer.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>By identifying a clear plan for reaching goals, a business strategy helps focus on capitalizing strengths by using them as a competitive advantage that makes the company unique in the marketplace.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What are the various parts of a business strategy?</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several components of a business strategy. They are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Vision and business objectives</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A business strategy is intended to help you reach your business objectives. With a vision for the direction of the business, you can create clear instructions in the business strategy for what needs to be done and who is responsible for completing each step.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Core values</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A business strategy guides top-level executives, as well as departments, about what should and should not be done, according to the organization&#39;s core values. It helps everyone stay on the same page and with the same goals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. SWOT analysis</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. This analysis is included in every business strategy, as it allows the company to rely upon its strengths and use them as an advantage. It also makes the company aware of any weaknesses or threats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Tactics</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many business strategies articulate the operational details for how the work should be done in order to maximize efficiency. People who are responsible for tactics understand what needs to be done, saving time and effort.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5. Resource allocation plan</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A business strategy includes where you will find the required resources to complete the plan, how the resources will be allocated and who is responsible for doing so. In this regard, you will be able to see where you need to add more resources in order to complete your projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>6. Measurement</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The business strategy also includes a way to track the company&#39;s output, evaluating how it is performing in relation to the targets that were set prior to launch the strategy. This helps you to stay on track with deadlines and goals, as well as budgetary concerns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Examples of Business Strategy</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a majority of the companies, a complete business strategy is based on a framework built on targeted types of strategies aimed at a particular keen area of the business. The following are some of the best examples of a successful business strategy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. Structuralist</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By adopting a structuralist strategy, you&rsquo;ll be building your business operations around the current market conditions and using the industry structure to your advantage. That might mean that you order products or supplies using your vendors&rsquo; established processes, or you take barriers to entry into consideration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>2. Growth</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re choosing a growth strategy, it means you&rsquo;re focused on introducing new products or features or expanding into new markets. Looking for a competitive edge by offering a unique experience your potential customers won&rsquo;t find anywhere else? Found a new customer base through market research or professional networking? That&rsquo;s when to consider a growth strategy for your business.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3. Cost Leadership</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Becoming a cost leader is a way to set your business apart by offering a competitive price for your product or service. If you have a unique strategy to lower costs without sacrificing quality, use that to set yourself apart in your industry. There are many benefits to being a cost leader including:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>4. Differentiation</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a truly unique product or service that you can offer to potential customers, you can stand out in the market. Differentiation allows a business to take a creative approach and charge premium prices for products or services.&nbsp; For example, Starbucks&reg; goes beyond selling coffee by providing a unique coffee experience in their stores. Strategies to drive brand differentiation include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Emotional response</strong></p>

<p><strong>Innovation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Creative presentation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unique experience</strong></p>

<p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5. Price-Skimming</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price-skimming strategies involve charging a high price for your product or service at the start to cover initial costs like production, manufacturing, and marketing. Usually, this approach makes sense for a business introducing something that hasn&rsquo;t been done before and that&rsquo;s worth a higher price. The advantages of a pricing policy are the ability to make your product appealing to customers, while covering costs. The disadvantages of pricing strategies that do not sufficiently appeal to customers will not provide the income you need to operate successfully.</p>1c6:T10f8,<p>Web analytics was the purview of large companies with fat wallets. This, however, no longer holds true. Today, both big and small companies use web analytics in one form or another, getting the most out of this technology in various ways. Modern companies can&rsquo;t afford to ignore it because there&rsquo;s an excellent chance that their competitors use this technology; if they don&rsquo;t use it, they&rsquo;d get left behind.&nbsp;It helps examine several things like the source of visitors, number of visitors, page views, and scrutinize their action on the website. Web analytics improve a company&rsquo;s decision-making process, providing them with insights gleaned from the collected data. Those insights help them create effective marketing campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Analyze the traffic of websites: </strong>Traffic is the most important metric to measure the performance of any website. It is very easy to track traffic to your website with the help of various web analytics tools. A good amount of traffic to any website specifies its growth; while, less traffic is a sign of the inactivity or decline of the website. It helps in planning the marketing campaigns consequently. Similarly, web analytics tools help track the repetitive, exclusive, and return visitors.</p>
<p>Here are some benefits that your business can get when you invest in web analytics:</p>
<p><strong>Ascertain the source of traffic:</strong>&nbsp;To know the source of your website traffic is one of the very significant factors to progress your website&rsquo;s performance. Web analytics tools help in dividing traffic into groups like referral, organic, social, and direct.

<p><strong>Creating Focused and Targeted Marketing Campaigns</strong>: A shotgun approach to marketing would be a colossal waste of money since it doesn&rsquo;t work. With web analytics, you can tailor marketing campaigns and products that can effectively reach your intended audience. Analytics can provide a detailed analysis of consumer trends, which could include online purchase monitoring and point-of-sale transactions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Early Recognition of Potential Risks</strong></h3>
<p>Today&rsquo;s companies operate in an environment that might be considered high-risk. This type of environment, however, makes businesses adapt and learn to manage different risks that they face. Fortunately, there are tools at their disposal, like web analytics. With the help of analytics, companies can spot trends that could affect them, enabling them to anticipate and adjust to potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if analytics indicate that your customers are increasingly getting younger, you can make a few adjustments to your marketing campaign that reflects this trend.</p>
<h3><strong>Build Strategies to Gain Referrals</strong></h3>
<p>Web analytics can also give you the chance to identify sites that get you the most referrals. Knowing them, you can analyze what you&rsquo;re doing right, perhaps give a few adjustments, and devise strategies to get even more referrals not only from them but from other sites, too.</p>
<p>If your analytics, for instance, show that the majority of your traffic comes from search engines, this would indicate a&nbsp;Strong SEO&nbsp;(search engine optimization). Armed with this knowledge, you&rsquo;ll know which practice is effective. Building from that, you could do a few tweaks to expand your online presence and attract more traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>1c7:T1140,<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.steelers.com/">Pittsburgh Steelers</a></strong> marked a significant turning point in their season with a commanding 37-15 victory over the New York Jets, showcasing the return of veteran quarterback Russell Wilson. After missing the first six weeks due to a calf injury, Wilson finally took the field, leading his team to a performance that ignited hope among fans and players alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wilson&rsquo;s Return: A Long-Awaited Comeback</strong></p>
<p>Russell Wilson's journey back to the starting lineup was fraught with challenges. Initially sidelined due to a calf strain sustained during training camp, Wilson's recovery process was closely monitored by the team's medical staff. As he gradually regained his fitness, Justin Fields filled in as the starting quarterback, leading the Steelers to a respectable 3-2 record during Wilson's absence. However, it was clear that the team was eager for Wilson's experience and skill set to elevate their offense.</p>
<p>In his debut against the Jets, Wilson demonstrated resilience and poise. Completing 16 of 29 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns, he quickly shook off any rust that had accumulated during his time on the sidelines. The Steelers' offense thrived under his leadership, averaging an impressive 6.3 yards per play and executing four passing plays of over 25 yards&mdash;an improvement from their previous six weeks where they managed only 13 such plays combined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coach Tomlin&rsquo;s Praise</strong></p>
<p>Head Coach <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin">Mike Tomlin</a></strong> was effusive in his praise for Wilson following the game. <em>&ldquo;I thought he was excellent,&rdquo;</em> Tomlin remarked. <em>&ldquo;He got better as the game went on... I thought he settled in, knocked the rust off, and distributed the ball around effectively.&rdquo;</em> This endorsement from Tomlin not only reflects Wilson&rsquo;s performance but also indicates a renewed confidence within the team.</p>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s ability to adapt quickly was crucial in this matchup. He connected well with his receivers and made decisive throws that kept drives alive. His performance not only showcased his individual talent but also highlighted a potential shift in the Steelers' offensive dynamics moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Najee Harris: A Multidimensional Offense</strong></p>
<p>Running back Najee Harris also weighed in on Wilson&rsquo;s impact on the team&rsquo;s strategy. He noted that Wilson&rsquo;s presence made the offense &ldquo;multidimensional,&rdquo; suggesting that this versatility could be pivotal as they aim for playoff contention. Harris emphasized that having multiple offensive threats is essential for success as they progress through the season.</p>
<p>The Steelers&rsquo; win against the Jets is not just a standalone victory; it represents a potential turning point for the franchise. With Wilson at the helm, there is optimism about what lies ahead. The combination of his experience and Fields&rsquo; earlier contributions could create a formidable quarterback duo that enhances competition and performance within the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead: Playoff Aspirations</strong></p>
<p>While it is still early in the season, Sunday night&rsquo;s game has set a positive tone for Pittsburgh's aspirations this year. The Steelers have shown flashes of brilliance, but consistency will be key as they navigate through their schedule. With Wilson now back in action, fans can expect an exciting brand of football characterized by aggressive play-calling and dynamic offensive strategies.</p>
<p>The road ahead is not without its challenges; however, with Wilson leading the charge, there is renewed hope for both players and supporters alike. As they prepare for upcoming games, maintaining momentum will be crucial for establishing themselves as serious contenders in their division.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Russell Wilson's return has reinvigorated the Pittsburgh Steelers, offering a glimpse of what could be possible as they aim for greater heights this season. With strong performances expected from both him and his teammates, fans are left eagerly anticipating how far this team can go under new leadership and strategy as they push towards potential playoff glory.</p>1c8:T1140,<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff"><strong>Coco Gauff</strong></a>, the world number six, showcased her exceptional talent by defeating unseeded Czech player Karolina Muchova in the final of the China Open on Sunday. Gauff's commanding performance led to a decisive 6-1, 6-3 victory, marking her as the first player in the Open Era to win her first seven WTA hardcourt finals.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Dominant Display</strong></h2>
<p>In a match that lasted just 77 minutes, Gauff displayed remarkable skill and poise on the court. She fired off an impressive 24 winners, demonstrating her aggressive playing style and ability to control the match. This victory adds another trophy to her collection, following her earlier triumph at the Auckland Classic earlier this year. With this win, Gauff has now secured two WTA 1000 titles in her career, including a previous victory against Muchova in Cincinnati earlier in 2023.</p>
<p>Gauff's win improved her head-to-head record against Muchova to 3-0 and solidified her standing as one of the most formidable players in women&rsquo;s tennis. Out of her nine WTA finals, she has won eight, showcasing her consistency and competitive spirit.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Acknowledging Her Opponent</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/coco-gauff-wins-china-open-tennis-karolina-muchova-final-report"><strong>Post-match</strong></a>, Gauff expressed admiration for Muchova, who has recently returned to competitive play after recovering from a wrist injury sustained during the 2023 U.S. Open. "Congratulations to you, Karolina; it's wonderful to see you back on tour," Gauff remarked. She praised Muchova's talent and resilience, hoping to see her reach many more finals in the future.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>New Beginnings with Coaching Staff</strong></h2>
<p>This tournament marked a significant milestone for Gauff as it was her first competition with <strong><a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/matt-daly/d447/overview">Matt Daly</a></strong> as part of her coaching team. Following her split with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert">Brad Gilbert</a></strong> last month, Gauff emphasized the importance of teamwork in her success. "I want to extend my gratitude to my team. This is our first tournament together as a complete unit," she stated, thanking Daly for his support throughout the week.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Match Breakdown</strong></h2>
<p>Entering the final, Gauff aimed to break a trend where she had lost the first set in three consecutive matches. She began strong by serving confidently and breaking Muchova early for a 2-0 lead. Maintaining momentum, Gauff continued to dominate by breaking serve again and extending her lead to 5-1.</p>
<p>Despite facing a breakpoint later in the set, she clinched it with an emphatic forehand winner. However, challenges arose in the second set when Gauff struggled with her serve, committing two double faults that allowed Muchova to take an early 2-0 lead. Nevertheless, Gauff quickly regained control by breaking back and winning four consecutive games.</p>
<p>Muchova struggled to maintain her composure after losing her lead and ultimately fell short as Gauff sealed the match with a break of serve when Muchova's backhand went long on match point.</p>

<h2><strong>Women's Doubles Final</strong></h2>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani">Sara Errani </a>&nbsp;</strong>and Jasmine Paolini triumphed in the women's doubles final by defeating Chan Hao-Ching and Veronika Kudermetova with a score of 6-4, 6-4. This victory marked their third WTA Tour title of the year.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Gauff&rsquo;s journey thus far serves as an inspiring testament to dedication and talent in sports, promising an exciting future as she aims for even greater achievements on the global stage.</p>1c9:T1255,<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. &mdash;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri"> The Kansas City</a></strong> Chiefs are grappling with the potential loss of star wide receiver <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice">Rashee Rice</a></strong> following a knee injury sustained during their recent victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. The team is currently awaiting further medical evaluations to determine the severity of the injury, which has raised concerns that Rice may have torn his ACL.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Injury Details</h2>
<p>The incident occurred in the first quarter of Sunday&rsquo;s game when quarterback<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes"> Patrick Mahomes</a></strong> inadvertently collided with Rice while attempting to tackle Chargers cornerback Kristian Fulton after an interception. The collision left Rice on the ground, prompting immediate medical attention. He was subsequently carted off the field, and initial assessments suggested a serious injury to his right knee. Although the Chiefs have not confirmed a definitive diagnosis, reports indicate that Rice is feared to have suffered a season-ending ACL tear.</p>
<p>Head coach Andy Reid confirmed that Rice would miss the upcoming game against the New Orleans Saints and mentioned that further tests are required to ascertain the full extent of the damage. "I don&rsquo;t have a definite [diagnosis] right now," Reid stated, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding Rice's condition.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Impact on the Team</h2>
<p>Rice has been a pivotal part of the<strong><a href="https://www.espn.in/nfl/story/_/id/41456791/chiefs-rashee-rice-leading-receiver-patrick-mahomes"> Chiefs&rsquo;</a></strong> offense this season, leading the team with 24 receptions, 288 receiving yards, and two touchdowns through the first three games. His absence poses a significant challenge for an already struggling passing attack. Mahomes expressed his concern for Rice, highlighting his teammate's toughness and resilience: "I know Rashee and how tough he is. So him being down like that, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In light of Rice's injury, Reid indicated that the team would adopt a more distributed offensive strategy rather than relying solely on rookie Xavier Worthy to fill the void. "We&rsquo;ve got guys here that have experience playing in the game," Reid noted, suggesting that multiple receivers will be utilized to mitigate Rice's absence.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Next Steps for Replacement</h2>
<p>With Rice sidelined, several players are expected to step up in his place. Worthy, who has shown promise as a first-round draft pick, leads the healthy wideouts with nine catches and two touchdowns this season. However, Reid emphasized that it wouldn&rsquo;t be solely Worthy&rsquo;s responsibility to compensate for Rice&rsquo;s production. Other receivers like JuJu Smith-Schuster and Skyy Moore are also anticipated to see increased roles in the offense.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuJu_Smith-Schuster">Smith-Schuster</a></strong> previously played a crucial role in the Chiefs' Super Bowl run in 2022 and has developed a rapport with Mahomes. Despite facing injuries that have affected his performance, he remains a trusted option for the quarterback. Meanwhile, Moore has had inconsistent performances but could seize this opportunity to solidify his position within the team's receiving corps.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>The Chiefs are already dealing with other significant injuries this season, including that of star running back Isiah Pacheco, who is expected to miss several weeks due to a fractured fibula. This series of setbacks raises questions about Kansas City's depth and ability to maintain its offensive effectiveness moving forward.</p>
<p>As they prepare for their Week 5 matchup against New Orleans, the Chiefs must adapt quickly while awaiting further updates on Rice's condition. The uncertainty surrounding his injury not only affects game strategy but also impacts team morale as they look to continue their undefeated start to the season.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs find themselves at a critical juncture as they navigate Rashee Rice's knee injury and its implications for their season. With key players sidelined and new challenges arising, how effectively they can adjust their offensive strategy will be vital in maintaining their competitive edge in the league. As they await more definitive news on Rice's health, both fans and teammates remain hopeful for a positive outcome.</p>1ca:T16da,<p>In games that were mostly based on thrill and spontaneity, the second week of the NFL season has delivered an enormous amount of interesting football. Ten matches were won on a single score, while four ended with game-winning points in the final moments. With such scenarios, it appeared nothing could be more exciting for the fans than the weekend of American football experienced last weekend. Four teams that missed out on the playoffs last season have opened the season at <a href="https://www.espn.in/nfl/story/_/id/41275907/nfl-week-2-2024-questions-takeaways-lessons-stats-recap-every-game"><strong>2-0</strong>,</a> which gives an indication that perhaps it might not be easy for anyone to win the league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bengals' Struggles Continue</strong></p>
<p>It's become a telltale sign under coach <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Taylor">Zac Taylor</a></strong> that the Cincinnati Bengals start the season with a record of 0-2 for the third consecutive year. Traditionally, the Bengals do not start well since they have lost their last seven games of Week 1 and Week 2. Having had victories propel them into the playoffs in 2021 and 2022, failing to make the playoffs this season might end for Taylor.</p>
<p>Mistakes and errors in addition to failure to convert on opportunities in this very tough AFC North could be a call for massive change if they do not pick up and turn their ways sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Injuries Piling Up on the Rams</strong></p>
<p>What could be viewed as an odd twist is that the Los Angeles Rams are now being seen as the NFC West's weakest link after their loss at the hands of the Arizona Cardinals. Injuries continue to be the problem plaguing the team as Puka Nacua is going to miss several weeks and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp">Cooper Kupp</a></strong> has already been photographed in a walking boot. Injuries have ravaged the offense line for the Rams, crippling them to a great degree in competing.</p>
<p>Owing to their obvious improvement, teams like the Cardinals and Seahawks don't look so farfetched at all, making it increasingly likely that the Los Angeles team will end the season at the bottom of their division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Baltimore's Playoff Hopes Dwindling?</strong></p>
<p>For the first time since 2015, Baltimore Ravens are experiencing an uncharacteristic start with an 0-2 record. Such beginnings historically were what spelled trouble for their chances at the playoffs. But they have struggled in holding leads late in games in a promising total yards differential. The schedule moving forward doesn't look so easy, with teams like the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in their way.</p>
<p>However, Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh as well as quarterback Lamar Jackson have space to breathe based on their previous games and will likely find a way to muscle through this tough period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Geno Smith: Scoring Machine or All Hype?</strong></p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith has been pretty good at coming down to crunch time, but declaring him as NFL's most clutch quarterback is too early. His performance against the New England Patriots showed that he certainly is made of stuff who can lead a rally, but it is the established stars like Patrick Mahomes who are still front-runners in this narrative. Statistics speak volumes about Smith's skills; only time will tell if he shall be able to do the same on consistent basis while under pressure against elite performers.</p>
<p>Saints' Offense</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints have asserted themselves as one of the most potent offensive machinery in the NFC, scoring an impressive 44 points against the Dallas Cowboys. The way they scored on every possession in the first half had all the makings of a team that could mushroom into something spectacular.</p>
<p>With Derek Carr at the helm and Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave doing so much of the heavy lifting in playmaking, this unit is poised to contest for conference supremacy if this level of play continues.</p>
<p>Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars, has been on to another disappointing outing as his team extended its losing streak to seven games. Lawrence has been struggling, and this makes one question the status quo in relation to his being the franchise quarterback, especially after there has been some quite a substantial investment into him by the organization. With only one win since last season, and such underwhelming performances, Lawrence must step it up real fast or more criticism about his future may suffocate him in discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marvin Harrison Jr. Rookie Implication</strong></p>
<p>And just like everybody else, rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., is making early ruffles in the NFL after a notable show against the Rams, recording four catches for 130 yards and two touchdowns-all coming within the first quarter of play. That type of explosive playing suggests that he can probably go over 1,000 receiving yards this season, marking him as one who will easily eclipse franchise marks set by previous glories.</p>
<p>And so, finally it all boils down to the emergence of Harrison, and who will be among the biggest exciters for the fans of the Cardinals, but also sets the stages for an exciting year in which to see the growth.</p>
<p>As week 2 closes, unpredictability has become the theme in the NFL this year. How each team will find ways to win or cope with losing has become of paramount importance as the injury bug starts to show its head and early-season lulls in play begin to settle in, as well. The Week ahead will hold many more twists and turns as fans see how their teams will recover.</p>1cb:T14ca,<p>In a thrilling development at the U.S. Open, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe">Frances Tiafoe</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/taylor-fritz/fb98/overview">Taylor Fritz</a></strong> have both secured spots in the semifinals, ensuring that an American man will compete in the final of the Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 18 years. This marks a significant moment for U.S. tennis, as the last time two American men reached this stage of the tournament was in 2005.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Tiafoe Advances with an Anticlimactic End</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-frances-tiafoe-reaches-semi-finals-after-grigor-dimitrov-retires-injured/articleshow/113049775.cms">Frances Tiafoe, </a><strong><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-frances-tiafoe-reaches-semi-finals-after-grigor-dimitrov-retires-injured/articleshow/113049775.cms">seeded 20th</a></strong> advanced to the semifinals after his quarterfinal opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, was forced to retire due to an injury. Tiafoe was leading 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 when Dimitrov withdrew from the match just before midnight. Despite the abrupt ending, Tiafoe expressed his satisfaction at making it to the final four again. "It&rsquo;s not the way I want to get through, but I&rsquo;m happy to advance. Another semifinal here is incredible,&rdquo; Tiafoe remarked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The match itself saw some erratic play from both players. Dimitrov, who was seeded 9th, had three set points during the tiebreaker at 6-3 but faltered with consecutive double faults. Tiafoe capitalized on these errors to win the set.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Fritz's Triumph and Emotional Victory</strong></h3>
<p>Taylor Fritz, in contrast, secured his semifinal berth in a more dramatic fashion. Fritz, seeded 12th, overcame Alexander Zverev, the 4th seed, with a score of 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3). The match ended with Fritz celebrating exuberantly as Zverev's final forehand shot sailed wide. The victory marked Fritz&rsquo;s first Grand Slam semifinal appearance, a significant milestone after several near misses in previous tournaments. "Come on!&rdquo; Fritz shouted as he dropped his neon-colored racket in celebration.</p>
<p>Fritz&rsquo;s victory was characterized by his powerful serving and effective net play, winning 20 of 21 points on his first serves in the fourth set and executing 16 successful net points out of 24.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>The Upcoming American Semifinal Showdown</strong></h3>
<p>On Friday, Fritz will face Tiafoe in what promises to be an electrifying all-American semifinal. The two players, both 26 years old, have a long history together, having competed against each other since their junior tennis days. Tiafoe holds a 6-1 head-to-head advantage over Fritz in their professional encounters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the biggest match of Taylor and my lives. We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long. Playing here will be awesome,&rdquo; Tiafoe said. Fritz echoed this sentiment, acknowledging the significance of their matchup.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Context and Recent History</strong></h3>
<p>The last American men&rsquo;s semifinal at a major was in 2005 when Andre Agassi defeated Robby Ginepri at the U.S. Open. No American man has won a Grand Slam singles title since Andy Roddick's victory at the 2003 U.S. Open. Roddick was the last American to reach the U.S. Open final, losing to Roger Federer in 2006.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Dimitrov&rsquo;s Injury and Other Quarterfinals</strong></h3>
<p>Dimitrov, who has previously reached the semifinals of three major tournaments, struggled with an injury, which eventually led to his withdrawal. The Bulgarian, who experienced a physically taxing five-set match in the fourth round, was visibly hampered during the later stages of his match against Tiafoe. Dimitrov mentioned he needed to reassess his situation but did not provide specifics about his condition.</p>
<p>The remaining men&rsquo;s quarterfinals will feature top players, including No. 1 Jannik Sinner against No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, and No. 10 Alex de Minaur versus No. 25 Jack Draper.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Women&rsquo;s Semifinal Update</strong></h3>
<p>In women&rsquo;s action, No. 13 Emma Navarro of the U.S. reached her first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating No. 26 Paula Badosa with a score of 6-2, 7-5. Navarro will face No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in her next match.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Fritz&rsquo;s Path to Success</strong></h3>
<p>Fritz's previous Grand Slam quarterfinals included losses to prominent players like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. However, his recent performance indicates growth and improved comfort in high-stakes situations. Coach Michael Russell highlighted that past losses were not a focus before this quarterfinal, emphasizing Fritz's mindset of continual improvement. "The job&rsquo;s not done yet,&rdquo; Fritz stated, reflecting his determination and readiness for the upcoming challenges.</p>
<p>As the U.S. Open progresses, the excitement around the American semifinalists and their potential impact on the tournament continues to build.</p>1cc:T11c5,<p>The atmosphere at the <strong><a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/venues/north-paris-arena">North Paris Arena</a></strong> was electric as the U.S. women's sitting volleyball team prepared to face host nation France in a much-anticipated match during the <strong><a href="https://www.paralympic.org/paris-2024">2024 Paris Paralympic Games.</a></strong> With chants echoing from the stands, the energy was palpable even before the first serve, which was delivered as an ace by U.S. setter Alexis Shifflett-Patterson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Dominant Performance</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. team showcased their prowess on the court, delivering a commanding performance that resulted in a 3-0 victory, with set scores of 25-5, 25-1, and 25-5. The Americans racked up an impressive 28 aces and a flurry of kills, overwhelming the French team, who struggled to gain any momentum throughout the match. Despite the lopsided score, the French fans remained spirited, cheering enthusiastically for their team.</p>
<p>U.S. captain <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1172720/">Monique Matthews</a></strong> expressed her appreciation for the lively atmosphere, stating, &ldquo;I love it. I love when we play the host country because it's just surreal, just the chanting and the cheering, like the roar of it. You just can't replace it or replicate it, and I just love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for the Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Head coach Bill Hamiter prepared his veteran squad for the intense environment they would face against France. He emphasized the importance of maintaining focus amidst the noise, a strategy that has served the team well in past competitions. Outside hitter <strong><a href="https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/emma-schieck">Emma Schieck </a></strong>echoed this sentiment, noting the excitement that comes with playing against teams that bring their best game, regardless of the crowd's support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that every team that we play is always going to give us their best game and it makes it exciting,&rdquo; Schieck said. &ldquo;Playing with a crowd like this is, whether it's cheering for you or cheering against you, it is an absolute blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bouncing Back from a Loss</strong></p>
<p>This match was particularly significant for the U.S. team, as they were looking to bounce back from a disappointing opening loss to China just days earlier. Historically, the Americans have faced similar challenges in previous <strong><a href="https://www.paralympic.org/paralympic-games">Paralympic Games</a></strong>, where they also lost to China in the preliminary rounds but ultimately went on to win gold. Matthews highlighted the importance of this victory for team morale, stating, &ldquo;It's always good to come out and get a win after a loss, just to build the morale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. players demonstrated resilience, quickly shaking off the loss and focusing on their next challenge. Schieck led the team with 11 kills, while Matthews and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Erickson">Heather Erickson </a></strong>contributed 10 kills each. The French team, in contrast, did not register a single ace and managed only 11 points throughout the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>The victory against France not only served as a morale booster but also reaffirmed the U.S. team&rsquo;s status as a formidable contender in the tournament. <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/us-womens-sitting-volleyball-team-214953422.html">Ranked No. 3</a><a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/us-womens-sitting-volleyball-team-214953422.html"> in the World ParaVolley standings, the Americans are aiming for their third consecutive gold medal. As they prepare for their next match against Italy, ranked No. 7, the team remains focused on their internal strategies rather than external competition.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamiter&rsquo;s message to the squad moving forward is clear: maintain focus and consistency. &ldquo;It's hard, but we've been together for, I don't know, at least 10 years, the squad,&rdquo; Matthews noted. &ldquo;So we're used to it. We're really good at coming together when we need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this strong performance behind them, the U.S. women's sitting volleyball team is poised to continue their pursuit of Paralympic glory in Paris, embodying the spirit of resilience and teamwork that has defined their journey thus far.</p>1cd:Tc76,<p>Lionel Messi, the world-renowned footballer and World Cup champion, made a significant stride in his recovery journey as he returned to practice with Inter Miami on Wednesday. This marks Messi's first public session with his teammates since sustaining a right ankle ligament injury during the Copa America final on July 14. The match, held at Hard Rock Stadium, saw Argentina clinch victory against Colombia, but it came at a cost for Messi, who was sidelined due to the injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Milestone in Messi&rsquo;s Rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p>At 37 years old, Messi&rsquo;s return to practice is a notable milestone in his rehabilitation process. Previously, he had resumed individual drills but had yet to rejoin his Miami teammates for a full practice. Wednesday's session was a crucial step forward, demonstrating his progress as he worked alongside his fellow players on the field for the first time since his injury. The session was a mix of relief and anticipation for fans and teammates alike, signaling that Messi&rsquo;s return to form might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Messi&rsquo;s Absence on Inter Miami</strong></p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s injury has kept him out of Inter Miami&rsquo;s last seven games, an absence that has been felt both on and off the pitch. Despite his unavailability, the team has shown remarkable resilience and performance. Inter Miami currently leads the MLS Eastern Conference, boasting a six-point lead over second-place Cincinnati. The team has also secured a playoff spot, further underscoring their impressive season. Their recent 2-0 victory over Cincinnati highlighted their capability to thrive even in Messi&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Big Question: When Will Messi Return?</strong></p>
<p>As the MLS season approaches its final stretch, fans are eagerly speculating about Messi&rsquo;s return. Inter Miami Head Coach Tata Martino has indicated that Messi will be back before the end of the MLS season, which runs through mid-October. However, the exact timing of his return remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Inter Miami&rsquo;s upcoming fixtures include an away game against Chicago Fire FC on Saturday, which may come too soon for Messi to make his comeback. If he is not fit in time for this match, the next potential opportunity for his return would be on September 14, during a home game against the Philadelphia Union. This scheduling gives Messi additional time to fully recover, as Argentina has opted not to select him for their World Cup qualifying matches on September 5 and 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s gradual return to fitness is a beacon of hope for Inter Miami and its supporters. As the team continues to excel in his absence, the anticipation surrounding his return builds. The star player's presence is expected to bring a significant boost as the season progresses towards its climax. For now, fans and teammates alike will be watching closely, hoping that Messi&rsquo;s recovery will continue to advance and that he will be back on the pitch soon to contribute to Inter Miami&rsquo;s success.</p>1ce:T11e1,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Government Accountability</span></strong></h4>

Here, three landmark studies presented at the <strong><a href="https://www.esmo.org/meeting-calendar/esmo-congress-2024">ESMO Congress 2024</a></strong> in Barcelona, Spain are discussed, where issues related to the safety of breastfeeding after diagnosis and a telephone-based coaching program for promoting physical activity in patients surfaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safety of Breastfeeding After a Breast Cancer Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The two studies investigated the impact of breastfeeding among young women diagnosed with breast cancer. The first study was a multicenter collaboration of research from 78 hospitals and cancer centers in 31 countries that assessed&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10518059/"> 474 patients</a></strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10518059/">with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The patients had ages less than 40 years with </a>Stage I-III invasive breast cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These women were followed up for a median time of seven years after delivery. Results showed that it did not make any significant difference whether a woman had nursed or not for the recurrence of cancer. This would mean cases of cancer within the primary tumour site and the contralateral breast; therefore, it shows that breastfeeding does not increase the risk of cancer recurrences or new cancers in such patients.</p>
<p>The second study was derived from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8365381/"> POSITIVE trial</a></strong>, with the main objective to understand if the temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to conceive is safe in women presenting with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. For this study, the participants included 518 women of age 42 or less, with 317 having fulfilled the definition for a live birth, and 196 opting to initiate breastfeeding. Results The outcomes of the study summarized above showed that these women could safely and feasibly breastfeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the safety only occurred in patients who had received a breast-conserving surgery. Dr. Ann Partridge, co-investigator of the two studies, stressed that these findings were greatly significant, providing crucial evidence that breastfeeding is indeed possible for younger survivors of breast cancer. In her statement, "Our findings highlight the potential to support maternal and infant needs without compromising maternal safety," referring to the significance of both maternal health and infant care needs have to be attended to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Physical Exercise through Coaching</strong></p>
<p>Improving Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors' Levels of Physical Activity Using a <strong><a href="https://society.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/telephone-based-coaching-intervention-leads-weight-loss">Telephone-Based Coaching Program: BWEL</a></strong> Trial In the third study, we aimed to improve overweight breast cancer survivors' levels of physical activity through a telephone-based coaching program. This study took place within the Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) trial, where we were interested in understanding whether there was any potential for structured weight loss interventions to decrease risks of cancer recurrence among women whose BMI fell into the overweight and obese categories.</p>
<p>3,180 women were randomly assigned to either of two groups. In one group, phone-based coaching aimed at lowering caloric intake and increasing exercise; in the second group, health education materials alone were provided. The baseline measurements are revealing as it presents that intervention arm women are largely inactive and, after six months, increased their average weekly exercise by as much as 40 minutes. Control group: The level of physical activity was not increased at any point in time.</p>
<p>The findings also showed that the subjects who had at least 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity were losing more weight as compared to those that were not. Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jennifer-a-ligibel">Jennifer Ligobel</a></strong>, a researcher of this study, noted that "a telephone-based weight loss intervention can stimulate this group of patients into being more active." The present study is expected to determine whether such increases in physical activity will translate into better cancer outcomes over a longer term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Future Research and Patient Care</strong></p>
<p>Together, they outline a critical step forward in the understanding of how lifestyle choices after diagnosis of cancer might themselves modify survivorship. The safety of breastfeeding by young mothers after diagnosis of breast cancer may reassure many women wrestling with agonizing decisions about motherhood after treatment. Also, effective interventions, such as telephone-based coaching, may empower patients to take greater control over their health, being more active physically and managing weight better.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the long term, further insight will be developed from observation of these patients by researchers on how lifestyle changes could improve general outcome in health for breast cancer survivors. Implications may unlock avenues to include supportive measures in standard care for the woman who navigates the 'aftermath of treatment' for breast cancer.</p>
<p>And so, in conclusion, these pioneering studies by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute not only give breast cancer survivors who are young pieces of mind concerning breastfeeding but equally remind the society of innovative approaches to improve their well-being through structured support programs.</p>1d1:T168b,<h4>In a groundbreaking study, researchers have discovered that adopting a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise like running, can counteract genetic predispositions to diseases.

The ostentatious display of luxury, featuring private jets, yachts, and star-studded parties, contrasted sharply with the crumbling business foundation.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Clark, along with business partners Dylan Suitor, Ryan Molony, and Aruba Butt, amassed hundreds of properties across Ontario, yet their opulent lifestyle masked mounting debt and unpaid bills. Despite the facade, court documents reveal a desperate struggle to keep up with loan payments and property maintenance.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As the spotlight dims on their extravagant escapades, the unraveling of their empire sheds light on a web of financial mismanagement and dubious lending practices. Their downfall serves as a cautionary tale of the perils of unchecked ambition and unsustainable growth in the real estate sector.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Robby Clark's journey from child actor to real estate magnate was marked by financial turbulence. Bankruptcy in 2009 was followed by failed business ventures, paving the way for his foray into real estate. However, his lack of financial literacy and reliance on others to secure loans laid the groundwork for future troubles.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Clark's corporation, SID Developments, alongside entities owned by Suitor, Molony, and Butt, embarked on a rapid acquisition spree, buoyed by loans arranged by mortgage broker Claire Drage. Drage's ties to private lenders facilitated a staggering number of loans, totaling over 1,300, fueling the empire's expansion.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Yet, beneath the veneer of success lay a crumbling foundation. Despite generating substantial rental income, the corporations struggled to meet debt obligations, resulting in a cascade of defaults and mounting lawsuits. The dream of vast wealth and billion-dollar holdings gave way to the harsh reality of insolvency.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The fallout from SID Developments' financial woes extends far beyond boardroom battles. In cities like Sault Ste. Marie, where the corporation owns a significant portion of the housing stock, the impact on tenants and communities is profound.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>With hundreds of properties in disrepair and mounting tax arrears, tenants face uncertainty and displacement. Local authorities grapple with property standard violations and unpaid taxes, exacerbating tensions between the corporation and the community.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Amidst the chaos, potential buyers like Core Developments offer a glimmer of hope, pledging to limit tenant displacement and restore stability. However, the specter of eviction looms large, casting a shadow over the fate of vulnerable renters caught in the crossfire of corporate collapse.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As the saga unfolds, it serves as a stark reminder of the pitfalls of unchecked greed and the need for greater oversight in the real estate industry. While the allure of wealth and luxury may dazzle, the consequences of financial mismanagement reverberate far and wide, leaving a trail of broken dreams and shattered lives in its wake.</h4>1d3:Te83,<h4>Heart disease stands as a significant health concern, surpassing cancer and other illnesses in its toll on lives annually.

Johnson, a 46-year-old tech mogul, has gained notoriety for his extreme dietary and lifestyle practices in his pursuit of longevity, including blood swapping with family members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew was inspired by Johnson's approach and decided to follow the Blueprint diet and document his experiences on his YouTube channel, Project Andrew. He noted significant results throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After just a week on the Blueprint diet, Andrew reported feeling "incredible" and lost an average of six pounds. His sleep quality also improved significantly, with an average sleep score of 95 percent, motivating him to continue the regimen for a total of 75 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Johnson's lifestyle reportedly costs around $2 million per year, Andrew, not being a millionaire tech mogul, made some adjustments. He used recipes from Johnson's website, selected specific vitamins, and spent approximately $112.34 per week on food and supplements, in addition to four hours per week on meal prep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of Andrew's experiment were impressive. He lost nearly 30 pounds, reduced his body fat percentage from 19 percent to 13.9 percent, and felt more focused and energized. He emphasized that the Blueprint lifestyle isn't just about diet or specific practices but revolves around data-driven health choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Andrew also pointed out some concerns, including the impact of calorie deficits on hormones and the complexity of Johnson's multifaceted approach. He encouraged others following the Blueprint lifestyle to share their data to determine its effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryan Johnson, who has invested millions in health initiatives, aims to achieve optimal health and longevity through rigorous monitoring and interventions, such as advanced medical testing and dietary practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the benefits, Andrew acknowledged that prioritizing health to the extent Johnson does can be incredibly challenging, especially in a world where such practices are far from the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson's pursuit of eternal youth includes regular health measurements and interventions, and he claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, and the fitness levels of an 18-year-old. His journey into longevity has garnered attention and intrigue, as well as questions about the feasibility and sustainability of such extreme measures.</p>1d5:T849,<p>After discovering his elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease, actor Chris Hemsworth, known for his role as "Thor," has embarked on significant lifestyle changes to prioritize his health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hemsworth, aged 40, now incorporates more solitude and mindfulness into his life, recognizing the importance of taking time for oneself without external distractions. He has always been committed to regular exercise but now places a stronger emphasis on stillness and mindfulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do a lot of meditation and breathwork, mostly during sauna and ice bath routines," he revealed. Hemsworth finds that immersive physical activities like surfing force him to be fully present, moving his focus from his mind to his body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revelation of Hemsworth's heightened Alzheimer's risk came in November during his Disney+ series, "Limitless," in a conversation with longevity physician Dr. Peter Attia. Hemsworth learned that he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, Hemsworth has taken several steps to prioritize his health:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improved Sleep Patterns: He focuses on consistent sleep routines, limiting screen time an hour before bedtime, and opting for reading to unwind. Additionally, he works on detaching from every thought and observing mental chatter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapted Fitness Routine: Hemsworth has adjusted his fitness regimen to incorporate more cardio and endurance workouts, moving away from heavy bodybuilding-style sessions. This change aligns with his evolving health goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Work-Life Balance: The actor values spending quality time with his children and appreciating the changing dynamics of family life. He aims to be more present and enjoy every moment, transitioning away from a hectic pace.</p>

Gen Z, often described as the generation with a unique perspective on work and life, is at the forefront of this shift, emphasizing a slower-paced life focused on self-care and happiness rather than relentless ambition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "snail girl" was coined by Sienna Ludbey, a designer and founder of Hello Sisi, in her article titled "'Snail girl era': Why I'm slowing down and choosing to be happy rather than busy." Ludbey shared her transformation from a "girlboss" who felt pressured to appear continuously successful to someone who values purpose and contentment more than societal expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an age where burnout has become a prevalent issue, particularly among young professionals, Gen Z is reevaluating the traditional notion of success tied to relentless work. The "snail girl" takes life at her own pace, focused on creating and enjoying the journey, regardless of the fast-paced world around her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of the "girlboss" has faced scrutiny in recent years as young individuals grapple with the idea that they must constantly improve or change themselves to succeed in the workplace. Michelle P. King, an expert in diversity and inclusion, argues that these ideas are inherently problematic as they imply that women must conform to male-dominated workplace norms.</p>1d7:T126a,<p>In a notable development within the European venture capital landscape, <strong><a href="http://node.vc">Node.vc</a></strong>, a Stockholm-based firm, has successfully raised &euro;71 million to support early-stage startups in the Nordic and Baltic regions.

He highlighted Europe's lag in operational experience compared to the U.S., noting that many claims of being founder-led often lack depth upon closer examination.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Deep Roots in Entrepreneurship</strong></h2>
<p>The foundation of Node.vc is built on genuine entrepreneurial experience. Elvesj&ouml; himself co-founded Tobii, a Swedish eye-tracking company that went public in 2015. The firm&rsquo;s investment team is complemented by a diverse group of limited partners (LPs), including 70 founders from various sectors. While these LPs are not obligated to contribute beyond financial support, their inclination to engage actively enhances the firm's investment strategy.</p>
<p>Securing institutional backing was crucial for Node.vc's fund size. Notable investors include Saminvest, a Swedish government-backed fund-of-funds, and Nordea's life and pension division. This combination of entrepreneurial and institutional support is particularly significant for a first-time fund.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Unique Operational Structure</strong></h2>
<p>Node.vc operates with an intentionally larger team than typical for its fund size. With eight full-time and eight part-time employees&mdash;many of whom previously worked at Nordic VC firm Brightly Ventures&mdash;the firm aims to effectively manage its planned investments in seven startups annually. Elvesj&ouml; explained this approach: &ldquo;We are entrepreneurs building a VC firm,&rdquo; emphasizing the need for adequate resources to nurture their portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The fund is designed to make initial investments averaging &euro;1.3 million, with the potential to follow up with additional funding up to &euro;10 million per company as needed.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Diverse Investment Focus</strong></h2>
<p>Although Node.vc maintains a sector-agnostic stance, it has identified three primary themes for its investments: the future of entertainment, future of work, and platform technologies. The firm has already made three investments in startups: Roro, a gaming studio; Lemonado, a no-code platform; and Starhive, a unified data management solution.</p>
<p>Elvesj&ouml; noted that these themes align with the strengths of the Nordic ecosystem but required extensive research to identify. &ldquo;We did this enormous investment in figuring out where trends are going,&rdquo; he said, reflecting on their strategic planning process.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Talent Availability Amid Market Changes</strong></h2>
<p>Interestingly, recent layoffs at several Scandinavian unicorns may benefit the startup ecosystem by increasing talent availability. Elvesj&ouml; remarked that "talent in the Nordics is more available than it&rsquo;s been for the last five years," positioning Node.vc favorably as it seeks to capitalize on emerging opportunities in technology sectors like AI.</p>
<p>As industries brace for disruption from AI tools, Node.vc believes the Nordics are well-equipped to harness these changes. The firm&rsquo;s commitment to fostering innovation positions it as a key player in shaping the future of technology across various sectors.</p>
<p>Node.vc's approach emphasizes collaboration between experienced entrepreneurs and emerging founders, aiming to create an ecosystem where innovative ideas can flourish. With its substantial backing and founder-first philosophy, Node.vc seeks not just to provide capital but also to offer invaluable insights and support throughout the entrepreneurial journey.</p>
<p>As Elvesj&ouml; succinctly put it, &ldquo;When we invest in a company, we bring much more than capital.&rdquo; This perspective underscores Node.vc's dedication to enhancing the startup landscape in the Nordics and beyond&mdash;an ambition that could signal a new chapter for venture capital in Europe.</p>1d8:T126e,<p>In a significant move to bolster executive retention during a tumultuous period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Global"><strong>Paramount Global</strong>'</a>s board of directors has approved substantial stock grants and enhanced compensation packages for its co-CEOs: <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-mccarthy-482a9583">Chris McCarthy</a></strong>,<strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2534535/bio/"> George Cheeks</a></strong>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Robbins"><strong>Brian Robbins</strong>.</a> Each executive will receive restricted stock valued at $3 million, a decision that reflects the company's ongoing transformation and the complexities surrounding its impending sale.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Background of Leadership Changes</strong></h2>
<p>The leadership shakeup at Paramount began in April when <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Bakish">Bob Bakish</a></strong> was ousted amid efforts to sell the company. Following this transition, Cheeks, McCarthy, and Robbins were appointed to the Office of the CEO. Cheeks oversees CBS, McCarthy is in charge of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios and Paramount Media Networks, while Robbins leads Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon. This restructuring comes as Paramount seeks to solidify its position in an evolving media landscape, highlighted by a recent agreement with Skydance that is expected to finalize in 2025.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Enhanced Compensation Packages</strong></h2>
<p>To reflect their new roles and responsibilities, the co-CEOs' compensation was significantly increased in June. Notably, their target annual cash bonuses were raised by an additional 100% of their base salaries under the company's short-term incentive plan. This adjustment aims to incentivize performance and ensure alignment with corporate goals during this critical phase.</p>
<p>In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Paramount outlined that these executives would be entitled to resign "for good reason," allowing them to collect severance payouts if their roles were materially altered. This provision is a common feature in CEO contracts but underscores the board's commitment to protecting its leadership team during uncertain times.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Long-Term Security Measures</strong></h2>
<p>The newly enhanced compensation will not only apply while the executives serve in their current roles but will also extend throughout their employment with Paramount, regardless of any future changes in title or responsibilities. This approach is relatively uncommon and indicates a strategic effort by the board to retain top talent amidst ongoing corporate challenges.</p>
<p>The recent SEC filing further detailed that Cheeks, McCarthy, and Robbins would qualify for severance payments amounting to twice their base pay should a change in ownership occur&mdash;a scenario that appears increasingly likely given the company's sale discussions. Additionally, they will continue receiving benefits for 24 months post-departure if they exit under these conditions.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Context of Corporate Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>These compensation adjustments come at a time when Paramount is navigating significant challenges, including recent layoffs affecting hundreds of employees as part of its restructuring efforts. The company is also dealing with public disputes involving Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder, and CBS News. These factors contribute to an environment where executive stability is paramount for maintaining investor confidence and operational continuity.</p>
<p>The June filing also indicated that while serving in the Office of the CEO, each executive would be eligible for an annual cash bonus of $2.75 million. This substantial financial incentive reflects both the high stakes involved in leading Paramount through its current challenges and the board's commitment to ensuring that its top executives remain focused on driving the company forward.</p>
<p>Paramount Global's decision to enhance compensation for its co-CEOs is a strategic maneuver aimed at retaining key leadership during a pivotal transition period. As the company prepares for potential ownership changes and continues to streamline operations amid industry-wide shifts, these measures are designed to secure executive commitment and stabilize corporate governance. With significant stock grants and robust severance provisions now in place, Paramount appears poised to navigate its complex landscape while ensuring that its leadership remains aligned with long-term objectives.</p>1d9:T1237,<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Steel"><strong>U.S. Steel's</strong></a> CEO, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Burritt">David Burritt,</a></strong> has raised alarms about the future of the company if its planned sale to Nippon Steel fails. According to a report from the Wall Street Journal, Burritt warned that the company might need to shut down steel mills and consider moving its headquarters out of Pittsburgh if the <strong><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-steel-warns-of-plant-closings-if-sale-collapses-4ef45756?mod=hp_lead_pos5">$14.1 billio</a><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/u-s-steel-warns-of-plant-closings-if-sale-collapses-4ef45756?mod=hp_lead_pos5">n acquisition does not go through.</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Importance of Nippon Steel's Investment</strong></h3>
<p>Burritt, who has led U.S. Steel <a href="https://www.sdgnewsgroup.com/nippon-steel-boosts-capital-commitment-to-u-s-steel-plants/article_7d74014c-699d-11ef-955e-5b5dd02b1466.html">&nbsp;<strong>since 201</strong></a><strong>7</strong> stressed that Nippon Steel&rsquo;s proposed investment of nearly $3 billion is crucial for modernizing U.S. Steel&rsquo;s outdated mills. This financial boost is seen as essential for maintaining the competitiveness of these facilities and safeguarding jobs. Burritt candidly admitted, &ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to proceed without this deal,&rdquo; highlighting the financial constraints the company faces.</p>
<h3><strong>Political and Labor Opposition</strong></h3>
<p>The potential sale has encountered significant resistance from various quarters. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has voiced concerns about U.S. Steel remaining under domestic ownership, which adds another layer of complication to the acquisition. Although Harris has not explicitly stated that she would block the transaction, her comments are perceived as a potential obstacle if the deal's regulatory review extends beyond the current administration. President Biden, along with Republican nominee Donald Trump and several members of Congress, has also expressed skepticism about the deal. Additionally, the United Steelworkers union is challenging the acquisition, further complicating the situation.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Impact on U.S. Steel&rsquo;s Stock and Internal Actions</strong></h3>
<p>U.S. Steel&rsquo;s stock price dropped by 6% on Tuesday, closing at $35.60, reflecting investor anxiety about the deal's uncertain outcome. In response, U.S. Steel plans to mobilize its employees on Wednesday at its Pittsburgh headquarters to advocate for the benefits of the Nippon Steel acquisition. The company has been actively working to garner support from elected officials and union leaders, but opposition remains strong.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Nippon Steel&rsquo;s Commitment and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/nippon-steel-make-additional-investment-us-steels-mills-2024-08-29/">Nippon Steel,</a>&nbsp;ranked as the world&rsquo;s fourth-largest steel producer by output, recently increased its investment commitment to $2.7 billion for upgrading U.S. Steel&rsquo;s mills. The Japanese steel giant has also pledged to prevent layoffs of hourly workers until 2026. This commitment is aimed at addressing U.S. Steel&rsquo;s ongoing financial difficulties, which include a decade of losses leading up to 2020 due to escalating costs and low steel prices. The company had previously delayed necessary maintenance and upgrades in an effort to cut costs and manage financial losses.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Potential Relocation and Future Plans</strong></h3>
<p>Burritt has indicated that if the deal falls through, U.S. Steel might have to close its Mon Valley operation, the last remaining steel mill in Pittsburgh. This potential closure would likely prompt the company to shift its production focus to the South, which could lead to relocating its headquarters to that region. Burritt noted, &ldquo;If that mill can&rsquo;t survive into the next decade, there&rsquo;s little reason for us to remain in Pittsburgh.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Nippon Steel&rsquo;s offer of $55 per share outpaced Cleveland-Cliffs&rsquo; cash-and-stock proposal, and U.S. Steel&rsquo;s shareholders approved the Nippon Steel deal earlier this year. However, the acquisition&rsquo;s path forward remains fraught with political, labor, and financial hurdles. As U.S. Steel grapples with these challenges, the future of its mills, workforce, and headquarters hangs in the balance.</p>1da:T12cb,<p><strong>A New Dawn for Bihar Startups</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicawang/?hl=en">Jessica Wang,</a> a 39-year-old small business owner, hails from the vibrant city of Los Angeles and now resides in Eagle Rock. Her story is a testament to resilience and creativity. With a deep-rooted passion for food, Jessica has carved out a niche for herself in the culinary world. She teaches fermentation classes and runs a unique grocery and deli bakery concept in Chinatown, aptly named Gu Grocery.</p>
<p>Wang's heritage plays a pivotal role in her business. "My family is Chinese from Taiwan, and I want to share my culture through the food I'm making," she says. This cultural influence is evident in the offerings at Gu Grocery, where traditional Taiwanese flavors meet contemporary culinary techniques. Jessica's journey, however, hasn't been without its hurdles.</p>
<h4><strong>A Year of Challenges: Overcoming Financial Hurdles</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reflecting-2023-year-achievements-challenges-tim-qyvje">The year 2023</a>&nbsp;marked a particularly challenging period for Jessica. "When 2023 came around, it just felt like everything was going downhill really fast," she recalls. The year started with her car breaking down, leading to unexpected expenses and logistical challenges. "Just starting the year with my car dying and having to get it towed," she adds, painting a picture of a tumultuous time.</p>
<p>Financial strain compounded her worries. An exorbitant electric bill&mdash;three times her usual amount&mdash;arrived at a moment when her income was uncertain. "It came to me when I didn't know when my next job was going to be," Jessica explains. As a small business owner, her energy was already stretched thin, and this unexpected expense was a heavy blow.</p>
<h4><strong>Embracing Support: Navigating CalFresh Benefits</strong></h4>
<p>In the face of financial difficulties, Jessica turned to CalFresh, California's food assistance program. "I thought: Maybe I need to learn about <a href="https://www.cdss.ca.gov/calfresh">CalFresh </a>benefits. I applied and I ended up being eligible," she shares. This decision marked a turning point. As a vendor at local farmers markets, she used her CalFresh benefits to purchase produce from her fellow vendors.</p>
<p>Initially, using CalFresh benefits came with a sense of self-consciousness. "The first few times, I felt like I had to explain myself," she admits. There was a fear of judgment, especially being a business owner and an EBT recipient. However, Jessica's practical approach and the supportive community at the market helped her navigate this period with dignity and determination.</p>
<h4><strong>Redefining Success: The Process of 'Making It'</strong></h4>
<p>For Jessica, the concept of "making it" is a dynamic and ongoing journey. "I really love the idea of 'making it' as literally making it," she says. To her, success is about creating something meaningful and fostering connections within the community. It's not just about achieving a goal, but about the continuous process of growth and creation.</p>
<p>"Based on my own definition of 'making it,' I do feel like I am making it," Jessica affirms. Her philosophy highlights the importance of perseverance and the value of community support in achieving one's dreams.</p>
<h4><strong>Looking Ahead: A Bright Future in Chinatown</strong></h4>
<p>Today, Jessica's financial situation has improved significantly. She secured grants and loans from <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdfi.asp">Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)</a>, which have been instrumental in her latest venture. This fall, she is set to open her grocery store, Gu Grocery, in Chinatown. This new chapter symbolizes not just a business expansion, but the culmination of years of hard work and dedication.</p>
<p>Jessica Wang's journey is an inspiring narrative of resilience, community, and the relentless pursuit of one's dreams. From the challenges of 2023 to the promising future of Gu Grocery, she embodies the spirit of "making it" in every sense of the term.</p>1dc:T10db,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Unexpected Journey to a Unique Mission</span></strong></h4>

<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Born into a family of Nepalese refugees in Bhutan, Odari's childhood was marked by hardship and uncertainty.

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">For Odari, cosmetics became more than just a passion; they became a tool for self-expression and empowerment.

The Financial Times reported that the firm identified these violations as a breach of its ethical guidelines and learning policies.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for EY emphasized the company's commitment to integrity and ethics, stating, "At EY, our core values of integrity and ethics are at the forefront of everything we do." Following a thorough investigation, those found guilty of violating the Global Code of Conduct were terminated.</p>
<p>Some affected employees expressed their disbelief at the severity of the punishment, arguing that they were unaware they were breaking any rules by signing up for multiple courses. They claimed that multitasking is often encouraged within the company culture, with some employees managing tasks across three monitors.</p>
<p>Despite these defenses, EY remained resolute in its decision to uphold its policies strictly. The firings have raised questions about the balance between fostering a productive work environment and enforcing corporate regulations.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Meta's Meal Voucher Misuse Scandal</strong></h2>
<p>In a related incident, Meta, the parent company of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><strong>Facebook</strong> </a>&nbsp;and <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a></strong>, recently terminated approximately 24 employees from its Los Angeles office for misusing meal vouchers intended for food purchases. The meal credits, valued at $25 each, were reportedly used to buy non-food items such as toothpaste and wine glasses. This misuse was uncovered during an internal investigation into the company's food credit system.</p>
<p>One employee, who was earning a substantial salary of $400,000 per year, admitted to using their meal credits for household items rather than food when they were not dining at the office. This individual described their experience as "surreal,"&nbsp; emphasizing that they did not perceive their actions as unethical. They rationalized their behavior by stating that they did not want to waste credits on days when they had alternative dining plans.</p>
<p>Meta's decision to terminate these employees has drawn criticism from those who believe that such actions should not warrant dismissal. Some staff members argued that occasional infractions should be met with warnings rather than immediate termination. However, Meta maintained that consistent misuse of meal credits warranted serious consequences as part of its broader restructuring efforts.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Broader Implications on Corporate Culture</strong></h2>
<p>The firings at both EY and Meta highlight a growing trend in corporate governance where seemingly minor breaches can lead to significant repercussions. As companies increasingly focus on maintaining strict ethical standards and cutting costs, employees may find themselves navigating more stringent rules in areas that might appear trivial.</p>
<p>These incidents raise important questions about employee relations within large organizations. Many employees feel disconnected from management when disciplinary actions seem disproportionate to the offenses committed. The sentiment among workers at both companies suggests a potential rift between corporate policies and employee behavior.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Accountability</strong></h2>
<p>As businesses like EY and Meta tighten their grip on ethical compliance and operational efficiency, the landscape of corporate discipline is evolving. Employees may need to adapt to an environment where even minor infractions could lead to severe consequences. While companies are justified in enforcing their codes of conduct, striking a balance between accountability and understanding employee behavior will be crucial in maintaining morale and productivity.</p>
<p>In summary, these recent terminations serve as a stark reminder that in today's corporate world, adherence to policy is paramount&mdash;even when it involves seemingly innocuous actions like attending multiple training sessions or misusing meal vouchers. As firms navigate these challenges, it remains to be seen how they will manage employee expectations while upholding their standards of conduct.</p>1e0:T117f,<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz"><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, once a leading figure in Hollywood, made headlines when she stepped away from acting in 2014 after her role in <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_(2014_film)"><em>Annie</em></a></strong>.

These allegations, announced by Texas-based attorney Tony Buzbee during a press conference, encompass serious claims of sexual abuse, including violent sexual assault, exploitation involving controlled substances, and the sexual abuse of minors.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Details of the Allegations</strong></h2>
<p>The lawsuits involve accusations from a diverse group of&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/sean-diddy-combs-to-face-120-accusers-alleged-sexual-misconduct/"> 120 plaintiffs</a></strong>&mdash;60 men and 60 women&mdash;who allege that Combs engaged in abusive conduct over a span of more than three decades, with incidents dating back to 1991. Buzbee highlighted the gravity of the allegations, stating that among the accusers, 25 were minors at the time of their alleged assaults. Disturbingly, he revealed that the youngest victim was just nine years old when the abuse occurred.</p>
<p>Buzbee described the nature of these claims as "gut-wrenching and heartbreaking," emphasizing that many victims reported their experiences to law enforcement while others chose not to. He expressed a commitment to uncovering all individuals who may have enabled Combs&rsquo; alleged misconduct, stating, "We will pursue this matter no matter who the evidence implicates.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Legal Context and Recent Developments</strong></h2>
<p>This surge in lawsuits follows Combs&rsquo; recent arrest on charges related to sex trafficking and racketeering. He has been held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center since September 16, where he awaits further legal proceedings. His legal team has categorically denied all allegations against him, labeling them as "false and defamatory." Attorney Erica Wolff stated that Combs looks forward to proving his innocence in court.</p>
<p>The upcoming lawsuits are part of a broader pattern of legal troubles for Combs, which intensified after his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura filed a civil suit accusing him of rape and physical abuse last November. Although they settled shortly after her allegations became public, the fallout has led to numerous additional claims against him.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Impact on Victims</strong></h2>
<p>Buzbee&rsquo;s firm has indicated that they have amassed substantial evidence for their cases, including photographs, videos, and text messages that could corroborate the victims' accounts. He noted that over <strong><a href="https://time.com/6196754/text-messages-evidence-court-privacy/">3,000 individuals </a></strong>&nbsp;have reached out to his office with claims against Combs, indicating a significant pattern of alleged misconduct within his circle.</p>
<p>The attorney emphasized the importance of addressing these issues publicly, stating that "the most significant secret in the entertainment world... has been disclosed." He further noted that many victims were promised opportunities in music or television but instead faced exploitation.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Broader Implications for the Music Industry</strong></h2>
<p>The allegations against Combs have reignited discussions about accountability within the entertainment industry. Buzbee criticized the culture that allows such abuses to persist unchecked. He remarked on the need for systemic change to prevent powerful figures from exploiting vulnerable individuals.</p>
<p>As these lawsuits unfold, they may not only impact Combs but also shed light on others who may have facilitated or ignored such behavior. The revelations could lead to broader scrutiny of industry practices and encourage other victims to come forward with their stories.</p>
<p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' situation is rapidly evolving as he confronts a deluge of serious sexual abuse allegations from over 120 accusers. The coming weeks will be critical as these lawsuits proceed through the courts and as more details emerge regarding both Combs' alleged actions and the systemic issues within the music industry that may have enabled such behavior for far too long. As this case develops, it stands as a stark reminder of the importance of accountability and justice for victims of abuse.</p>1e2:T13ae,<p><strong>Renowned Producer to Guide Rome-Based Entertainment Firm's Global Ambitions</strong></p>

The company announced an expected profit of HK$119.4 million (approximately $15.32 million) for the period, marking a stark contrast to the HK$3 million (around $384,880) loss it experienced during the same period in 2023. This drastic shift in financial performance signals a robust recovery and growth trajectory, anchored by the flourishing casino industry in Macau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Casino Kam Pek Paradise: A Key Revenue Engine</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the primary drivers of this impressive financial performance has been the 48.5 percent surge in revenue from casino management services. At the heart of this growth is Casino Kam Pek Paradise, which has seen a substantial increase in gaming revenue. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau">Macau</a>, known as the gambling capital of the world, has experienced a resurgence in its casino industry, and Paradise Entertainment has strategically positioned itself to capitalize on this growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company's focus on optimizing casino operations and enhancing the gaming experience at <a href="https://www.paradise-macau.com/en/">Casino Kam Pek Paradise</a> has paid off handsomely. With more visitors flocking to Macau&rsquo;s casinos, drawn by the allure of gaming and entertainment, Paradise Entertainment has managed to boost its revenue significantly, contributing to the company's overall profitability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Explosive Growth of Electronic Gaming Equipment</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another major contributor to Paradise Entertainment&rsquo;s financial success is the staggering 1,743.2 percent increase in revenue from the sale and leasing of electronic gaming equipment and systems in Macau. This segment of the business has seen exponential growth, primarily driven by rising demand for live multi-game terminals and related products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The surge in demand for these electronic gaming systems can be attributed to the evolving preferences of casino-goers, who are increasingly drawn to innovative gaming experiences. Paradise Entertainment has responded to this trend by expanding its product offerings and investing in cutting-edge technology, which has, in turn, fueled its revenue growth. The company&rsquo;s ability to tap into this lucrative market segment has provided a significant boost to its overall financial performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Year of Recovery and Growth</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paradise Entertainment&rsquo;s impressive results for the first half of the year build on a strong performance in 2023. Last year, the company posted a revenue of HK$634.3 million (approximately $81 million), representing a 113 percent year-on-year increase. This growth was accompanied by a significant improvement in the company&rsquo;s adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), which reached HK$133.6 million, compared to a negative figure of HK$109 million the previous year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s profit attributable to its owners also saw a notable increase, reaching just under HK$65.8 million (about $8.4 million) in 2023. These figures reflect Paradise Entertainment&rsquo;s successful efforts to streamline operations, optimize costs, and capitalize on the growing demand in Macau&rsquo;s casino and gaming equipment markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Paradise Entertainment prepares to publish its detailed financial results for the first six months of the year by the end of August, the company&rsquo;s strong performance in Macau sets the stage for continued growth. With the casino industry in Macau showing no signs of slowing down, and the increasing popularity of electronic gaming systems, Paradise Entertainment is well-positioned to maintain its upward trajectory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dramatic turnaround in the company&rsquo;s fortunes underscores its resilience and strategic acumen in navigating the complexities of the gaming industry. As the year progresses, all eyes will be on Paradise Entertainment to see if it can sustain this momentum and continue to deliver strong financial results.</p>1e4:Tfef,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Fond Tributes Pour In</span></strong></h4>

Developed by the producing team of D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, who are well-known for their work on "Game of Thrones," this thought-provoking science-fiction concept features a story that quickly reveals mysteries throughout its eight-episode premiere, laying the groundwork for a multitude of challenges to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are not familiar with the show's plot may find it ruined if they go too deeply into it. The show is an adaptation of Chinese novelist Liu Cixin's works. It is safe to say, nevertheless, that the premise sets up a huge mystery: a string of scientist killings, each one suggesting a motive that progressively becomes clear at a speed that defies standard first-season tropes. The scientists also struggle with strange visions in which they see numerical sequences that appear to count down to an unidentified event. This raises the crucial question of what will happen at the end of the countdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story mainly centers on a diverse group of friends who are deeply involved in science and who lose one of their own. These friends are portrayed by gifted performers like Jovan Adepo, Jess Hong, and Eiza Gonz&aacute;lez. Meanwhile, a dedicated investigator, played by Benedict Wong of "Doctor Strange" renown, delves into the related cases, and Liam Cunningham's character, along with former "Thrones" cast members John Bradley and Jonathan Pryce, helps a government official grasp the larger picture of the approaching conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second narrative thread that is deeply entwined with the plot centers on Zine Tseng's character, Ye Wenjie, a young Chinese scientist who navigates the turbulent 1960s China under Communist government while anticipating the difficulties that will face the aforementioned characters decades later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"3 Body Problem," a physics-based title, is akin to "Game of Thrones" in that it begins with an impending threat and then explores complex political dynamics and relationships within its world, all the while keeping the impending existential danger close at hand as the story progresses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>comparable to the complicated story of a work like "Foundation," which has presented a comparable issue in its adaptation for Apple TV+, the complexities of this vast, time-shifting serial constitute a formidable storytelling challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show, which is directed by Rian Johnson and starred Brad Pitt among a diverse group of co-producers, is managed by Benioff and Weiss in association with producer Alexander Woo of "The Terror," and despite these narrative complexities, it manages to keep a compelling and engaging narrative flow throughout its lengthy introduction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the finale of "Stranger Things" approaching, Netflix is looking to attract viewers with new shows in the genre landscape. "3 Body Problem" stands out as a unique offering that will pique viewers' interest in gripping narratives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting a metamorphic trip from page to screen, it is unclear where this complex and challenging story will go in the future. But after the first season's immersive experience, the difficulties shown in the show seem sophisticated and captivating, indicating that viewers would have a top-notch viewing experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 21, "3 Body Problem" will make its much awaited Netflix debut, bringing viewers into a mysterious, intriguing, and intellectually stimulating world.</p>1e6:Tc3c,<p>Renowned comedian and actor Richard Lewis, celebrated for his distinctive roles in HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" and the comedic gem "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," has passed away at the age of 76. His demise, attributed to a heart attack, occurred at his residence in Los Angeles on Tuesday night, as confirmed by his publicist Jeff Abraham in a statement to ABC News. The statement, conveying gratitude from his wife, Joyce Lapinsky, for the outpouring of love and support, also implored for privacy during this somber period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lewis, who bravely disclosed his battle with Parkinson's disease last year, left an indelible mark on the world of comedy. Known for his acerbic wit and candid humor, Lewis ascended from the vibrant comedy club circuit to illustrious appearances on late-night talk shows, notably gracing "The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" throughout the '70s and '80s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His notable ventures extended to the small screen, where he starred in the ABC sitcom "Anything but Love" alongside Jamie Lee Curtis, portraying co-workers navigating the complexities of romance within a magazine office setting in Chicago. Furthermore, his portrayal of a fictionalized version of himself in Larry David's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" resonated deeply with audiences, a role he continued into the ongoing 12th season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lewis' cinematic contributions were equally lauded, particularly his portrayal of Prince John in Mel Brooks' comedic masterpiece "Robin Hood: Men in Tights," a role that showcased his comedic prowess opposite Cary Elwes. Additionally, his performance in the Oscar-winning drama "Leaving Las Vegas" alongside Nicolas Cage and Elisabeth Shue further underscored his versatility as an actor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a poignant video shared on X (formerly Twitter) in April 2023, Lewis announced his retirement from stand-up comedy after nearly five decades in the industry. It was during this announcement that he candidly revealed his Parkinson's diagnosis, a condition he had been grappling with for two years prior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent interviews, Lewis reflected on how his journey with Parkinson's had shaped his perspective, acknowledging a newfound sense of gratitude and acceptance amidst life's challenges. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Englewood, New Jersey, Lewis was unflinchingly honest about his mental health struggles and recovery from substance abuse, chronicled in his memoirs "The Other Great Depression" (2000) and "Reflections From Hell: Richard Lewis' Guide on How Not to Live" (2015).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Larry David, Lewis' co-star and longtime friend, expressed profound grief over the loss, reminiscing on their enduring bond. David fondly recalled Lewis as not only the funniest person but also the kindest, whose departure left an irreplaceable void.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The Nobel committee praised the 64-year-old writer for his "innovative plays and prose, which give voice to the unsayable."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anders Olsson, chair of the Nobel literature committee, commended Fosse's extensive body of work, which includes approximately 40 plays, numerous novels, essays, and children's books. Olsson highlighted that Fosse's writing, rooted in the language and literature of his Norwegian heritage while incorporating modernist artistic techniques, delves into the core of human anxiety and ambivalence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fosse, who has been a Nobel contender for over a decade, received the news of his award while driving through the countryside near Bergen. He expressed feeling "overwhelmed and somewhat frightened," viewing the recognition as an honor to literature that prioritizes being literature above all else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Critics regard Fosse's multi-part work "Septology" as his magnum opus. The final installment of this series was shortlisted for the International Booker Prize and was described by the Financial Times as a "Nordic triptych on art, alcoholism, and the Almighty."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fosse's upcoming release, "A Shining," is described as "strange, haunting, and dreamlike." It follows the story of a man who embarks on a journey without a destination and encounters mysterious beings amid the obscurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to his novels, Fosse is acclaimed for his extensive contributions to the stage. His plays have earned him the title of "a new Ibsen" in Norway and have been performed across Europe. Notable adaptations include "I Am the Wind," which premiered at the Young Vic in London in 2011, and Georg Friedrich Haas's operatic rendition of his story "Morning and Evening," praised for its brooding, existentialist atmosphere at the Royal Opera House in 2015.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview with the FT in 2018, Fosse acknowledged that his books are not primarily known for their plots but emphasized his commitment to writing with simplicity and depth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jon Fosse becomes the fourth Norwegian writer to receive the prestigious Nobel Prize in Literature, accompanied by an award of SKr11 million ($1 million). Last year's recipient was the French author Annie Ernaux. This recognition marks the fourth recent Nobel Prize in Literature for works published in English in the UK by the independent publisher Fitzcarraldo, an impressive achievement for a company established just nine years ago.</p>1ea:T5c1,<p>Lady Gaga is not obligated to pay a $500,000 reward to Jennifer McBride, who returned the singer's stolen dogs in 2021, as ruled by a US judge. Jennifer McBride had filed a lawsuit against Lady Gaga, seeking the reward and an additional $1.5 million in damages. However, the judge stated that McBride was not entitled to the reward because her involvement in returning the dogs had led to a conviction for receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident in question occurred when Lady Gaga's three French bulldogs were stolen in Hollywood in February 2021, and the dog walker, Ryan Fischer, was shot. James Howard Jackson, one of the culprits, was later sentenced to 21 years in prison for attempted murder. Two of the stolen dogs were returned unharmed by McBride, and she subsequently sought the reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McBride was arrested in April 2021 and charged with being an accessory to attempted murder. In December, she entered a plea deal, and the charge was dropped in exchange for a plea of no contest to receiving stolen property, resulting in a two-year probation sentence. McBride claimed that she took possession of Lady Gaga's dogs to ensure their safety and return.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The judge upheld the previous ruling, emphasizing that McBride could not claim the reward due to her involvement in the theft and subsequent conviction, stating that she had "unclean hands" preventing her from benefiting from her actions.</p>1eb:Te6f,<p>Morocco, known for its rich culture and cinematic contributions, has officially submitted Asmae El Moudir's remarkable film, "The Mother of All Lies," as its candidate for Best International Film at the prestigious 96th Academy Awards.</p>
<p>This bold move highlights Morocco's commitment to showcasing its talent on the global stage.</p>
<h2>A Tale of Resilience: "The Mother of All Lies"</h2>
<p>"The Mother of All Lies" is a hybrid documentary that draws its inspiration from the infamous bread riots that shook El Moudir's hometown of Casablanca in 1981.</p>
<p>This emotionally charged masterpiece made its world premiere at the illustrious Cannes Film Festival this year, leaving audiences and critics in awe.</p>
<p>The film achieved a momentous feat by clinching the coveted Cannes&rsquo; L&rsquo;Oeil d&rsquo;Or (Golden Eye) prize for the Best Documentary, sharing the honor with Tunisian filmmaker Kaouther Ben Hania's "Four Daughters," Tunisia's own entry for this year's Oscars.</p>
<h2>A Glimpse into the Past</h2>
<p>Asmae El Moudir, a talented director, screenwriter, and producer, meticulously crafted "The Mother of All Lies." Her dedication to her craft and her unique perspective as a Casablanca native shine through in this documentary.</p>
<p>Using a handmade replica of the Casablanca neighborhood where she grew up, El Moudir artfully pieces together the trauma endured by the local community during the riots&mdash;a narrative that had remained unprocessed collectively out in the open for far too long.</p>
<h2>A Global Stage</h2>
<p>Morocco's submission of "The Mother of All Lies" to the Best International Film category demonstrates its continued commitment to the world of cinema. The film joins two other outstanding feature documentaries: Kleber Mendon&ccedil;a Filho&rsquo;s "Doc Pictures Of Ghosts," Brazil's official entry, and "Four Daughters" from Tunisia.</p>
<p>El Moudir's journey to becoming a celebrated filmmaker has been marked by dedication and talent. She honed her skills at La F&eacute;mis in Paris and holds a master's degree in production from the Superior Institute of Information and Communication in Rabat.</p>
<p>Her previous short documentaries have been showcased by prominent networks such as SNRT, Al Jazeera Documentary, BBC, and Al Araby TV, earning accolades at festivals worldwide. "The Mother of All Lies" is her remarkable second feature film, following the success of her debut, "The Postcard," in 2020.</p>
<h2>A Collaborative Effort</h2>
<p>The creation of "The Mother of All Lies" was a labor of love led by Asmae El Moudir herself, who not only directed but also wrote, produced, and edited the film.</p>
<p>Egypt's Marc Lotfy contributed to the project as a co-producer under the banner of his Fig Leaf Studios company. The film's international sales are handled by Vienna-based Autlook Filmsales, a testament to its global appeal.</p>
<h2>Countdown to the Oscars</h2>
<p>As the anticipation builds, filmmakers and audiences alike eagerly await the Academy's decision. The deadline for submissions to the Best International Feature Film category is October 2. The long list of nominees will be unveiled on December 21, with the final nominee list set to be revealed on January 23, just ahead of the grand ceremony scheduled for March 10, 2024.</p>
<p>Morocco's submission of Asmae El Moudir's "The Mother of All Lies" is a testament to the nation's vibrant cinematic culture and its desire to share stories that resonate with audiences worldwide. This remarkable documentary promises to captivate hearts and minds, shedding light on a chapter of history that deserves to be remembered and understood.</p>1ec:T1385,<p>The nominees for the Green Sport Awards by BBC Sport have been revealed.

1f5:T1140,<p>The <strong><a href="https://www.steelers.com/">Pittsburgh Steelers</a></strong> marked a significant turning point in their season with a commanding 37-15 victory over the New York Jets, showcasing the return of veteran quarterback Russell Wilson. After missing the first six weeks due to a calf injury, Wilson finally took the field, leading his team to a performance that ignited hope among fans and players alike.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wilson&rsquo;s Return: A Long-Awaited Comeback</strong></p>
<p>Russell Wilson's journey back to the starting lineup was fraught with challenges. Initially sidelined due to a calf strain sustained during training camp, Wilson's recovery process was closely monitored by the team's medical staff. As he gradually regained his fitness, Justin Fields filled in as the starting quarterback, leading the Steelers to a respectable 3-2 record during Wilson's absence. However, it was clear that the team was eager for Wilson's experience and skill set to elevate their offense.</p>
<p>In his debut against the Jets, Wilson demonstrated resilience and poise. Completing 16 of 29 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns, he quickly shook off any rust that had accumulated during his time on the sidelines. The Steelers' offense thrived under his leadership, averaging an impressive 6.3 yards per play and executing four passing plays of over 25 yards&mdash;an improvement from their previous six weeks where they managed only 13 such plays combined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Coach Tomlin&rsquo;s Praise</strong></p>
<p>Head Coach <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin">Mike Tomlin</a></strong> was effusive in his praise for Wilson following the game. <em>&ldquo;I thought he was excellent,&rdquo;</em> Tomlin remarked. <em>&ldquo;He got better as the game went on... I thought he settled in, knocked the rust off, and distributed the ball around effectively.&rdquo;</em> This endorsement from Tomlin not only reflects Wilson&rsquo;s performance but also indicates a renewed confidence within the team.</p>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s ability to adapt quickly was crucial in this matchup. He connected well with his receivers and made decisive throws that kept drives alive. His performance not only showcased his individual talent but also highlighted a potential shift in the Steelers' offensive dynamics moving forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Najee Harris: A Multidimensional Offense</strong></p>
<p>Running back Najee Harris also weighed in on Wilson&rsquo;s impact on the team&rsquo;s strategy. He noted that Wilson&rsquo;s presence made the offense &ldquo;multidimensional,&rdquo; suggesting that this versatility could be pivotal as they aim for playoff contention. Harris emphasized that having multiple offensive threats is essential for success as they progress through the season.</p>
<p>The Steelers&rsquo; win against the Jets is not just a standalone victory; it represents a potential turning point for the franchise. With Wilson at the helm, there is optimism about what lies ahead. The combination of his experience and Fields&rsquo; earlier contributions could create a formidable quarterback duo that enhances competition and performance within the team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead: Playoff Aspirations</strong></p>
<p>While it is still early in the season, Sunday night&rsquo;s game has set a positive tone for Pittsburgh's aspirations this year. The Steelers have shown flashes of brilliance, but consistency will be key as they navigate through their schedule. With Wilson now back in action, fans can expect an exciting brand of football characterized by aggressive play-calling and dynamic offensive strategies.</p>
<p>The road ahead is not without its challenges; however, with Wilson leading the charge, there is renewed hope for both players and supporters alike. As they prepare for upcoming games, maintaining momentum will be crucial for establishing themselves as serious contenders in their division.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Russell Wilson's return has reinvigorated the Pittsburgh Steelers, offering a glimpse of what could be possible as they aim for greater heights this season. With strong performances expected from both him and his teammates, fans are left eagerly anticipating how far this team can go under new leadership and strategy as they push towards potential playoff glory.</p>1f4:{"id":117,"title":"Steelers' New Era: Russell Wilson Shines in His Debut","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1729573585.png","content_details":"$1f5","status":null,"meta_title":"Steelers' New Era: Russell Wilson Shines in His Debut","meta_description":"Steelers' New Era: Russell Wilson Shines in His Debut","meta_keywords":"Steelers' New Era, Russell Wilson, Shines, Debut","image_alt":"Steelers' New Era: Russell Wilson Shines in His Debut","url":"steelers-new-era-russell-wilson-shines-in-his-debut","created_at":"2024-10-22T05:06:25.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-10-22T05:06:25.000000Z"}
1f7:T1140,<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff"><strong>Coco Gauff</strong></a>, the world number six, showcased her exceptional talent by defeating unseeded Czech player Karolina Muchova in the final of the China Open on Sunday. Gauff's commanding performance led to a decisive 6-1, 6-3 victory, marking her as the first player in the Open Era to win her first seven WTA hardcourt finals.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Dominant Display</strong></h2>
<p>In a match that lasted just 77 minutes, Gauff displayed remarkable skill and poise on the court. She fired off an impressive 24 winners, demonstrating her aggressive playing style and ability to control the match. This victory adds another trophy to her collection, following her earlier triumph at the Auckland Classic earlier this year. With this win, Gauff has now secured two WTA 1000 titles in her career, including a previous victory against Muchova in Cincinnati earlier in 2023.</p>
<p>Gauff's win improved her head-to-head record against Muchova to 3-0 and solidified her standing as one of the most formidable players in women&rsquo;s tennis. Out of her nine WTA finals, she has won eight, showcasing her consistency and competitive spirit.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Acknowledging Her Opponent</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/06/coco-gauff-wins-china-open-tennis-karolina-muchova-final-report"><strong>Post-match</strong></a>, Gauff expressed admiration for Muchova, who has recently returned to competitive play after recovering from a wrist injury sustained during the 2023 U.S. Open. "Congratulations to you, Karolina; it's wonderful to see you back on tour," Gauff remarked. She praised Muchova's talent and resilience, hoping to see her reach many more finals in the future.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>New Beginnings with Coaching Staff</strong></h2>
<p>This tournament marked a significant milestone for Gauff as it was her first competition with <strong><a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/matt-daly/d447/overview">Matt Daly</a></strong> as part of her coaching team. Following her split with <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert">Brad Gilbert</a></strong> last month, Gauff emphasized the importance of teamwork in her success. "I want to extend my gratitude to my team. This is our first tournament together as a complete unit," she stated, thanking Daly for his support throughout the week.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Match Breakdown</strong></h2>
<p>Entering the final, Gauff aimed to break a trend where she had lost the first set in three consecutive matches. She began strong by serving confidently and breaking Muchova early for a 2-0 lead. Maintaining momentum, Gauff continued to dominate by breaking serve again and extending her lead to 5-1.</p>
<p>Despite facing a breakpoint later in the set, she clinched it with an emphatic forehand winner. However, challenges arose in the second set when Gauff struggled with her serve, committing two double faults that allowed Muchova to take an early 2-0 lead. Nevertheless, Gauff quickly regained control by breaking back and winning four consecutive games.</p>
<p>Muchova struggled to maintain her composure after losing her lead and ultimately fell short as Gauff sealed the match with a break of serve when Muchova's backhand went long on match point.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Women's Doubles Final</strong></h2>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Errani">Sara Errani </a>&nbsp;</strong>and Jasmine Paolini triumphed in the women's doubles final by defeating Chan Hao-Ching and Veronika Kudermetova with a score of 6-4, 6-4. This victory marked their third WTA Tour title of the year.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>With this latest victory, Coco Gauff not only adds another title to her impressive resume but also positions herself favorably for upcoming tournaments. She is set to compete next at the Wuhan Open, also taking place in China.

1f9:T1255,<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. &mdash;<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri"> The Kansas City</a></strong> Chiefs are grappling with the potential loss of star wide receiver <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice">Rashee Rice</a></strong> following a knee injury sustained during their recent victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. The team is currently awaiting further medical evaluations to determine the severity of the injury, which has raised concerns that Rice may have torn his ACL.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Injury Details</h2>
<p>The incident occurred in the first quarter of Sunday&rsquo;s game when quarterback<strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes"> Patrick Mahomes</a></strong> inadvertently collided with Rice while attempting to tackle Chargers cornerback Kristian Fulton after an interception. The collision left Rice on the ground, prompting immediate medical attention. He was subsequently carted off the field, and initial assessments suggested a serious injury to his right knee. Although the Chiefs have not confirmed a definitive diagnosis, reports indicate that Rice is feared to have suffered a season-ending ACL tear.</p>
<p>Head coach Andy Reid confirmed that Rice would miss the upcoming game against the New Orleans Saints and mentioned that further tests are required to ascertain the full extent of the damage. "I don&rsquo;t have a definite [diagnosis] right now," Reid stated, emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding Rice's condition.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Impact on the Team</h2>
<p>Rice has been a pivotal part of the<strong><a href="https://www.espn.in/nfl/story/_/id/41456791/chiefs-rashee-rice-leading-receiver-patrick-mahomes"> Chiefs&rsquo;</a></strong> offense this season, leading the team with 24 receptions, 288 receiving yards, and two touchdowns through the first three games. His absence poses a significant challenge for an already struggling passing attack. Mahomes expressed his concern for Rice, highlighting his teammate's toughness and resilience: "I know Rashee and how tough he is. So him being down like that, I knew it wasn&rsquo;t good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In light of Rice's injury, Reid indicated that the team would adopt a more distributed offensive strategy rather than relying solely on rookie Xavier Worthy to fill the void. "We&rsquo;ve got guys here that have experience playing in the game," Reid noted, suggesting that multiple receivers will be utilized to mitigate Rice's absence.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Next Steps for Replacement</h2>
<p>With Rice sidelined, several players are expected to step up in his place. Worthy, who has shown promise as a first-round draft pick, leads the healthy wideouts with nine catches and two touchdowns this season. However, Reid emphasized that it wouldn&rsquo;t be solely Worthy&rsquo;s responsibility to compensate for Rice&rsquo;s production. Other receivers like JuJu Smith-Schuster and Skyy Moore are also anticipated to see increased roles in the offense.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JuJu_Smith-Schuster">Smith-Schuster</a></strong> previously played a crucial role in the Chiefs' Super Bowl run in 2022 and has developed a rapport with Mahomes. Despite facing injuries that have affected his performance, he remains a trusted option for the quarterback. Meanwhile, Moore has had inconsistent performances but could seize this opportunity to solidify his position within the team's receiving corps.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Broader Implications</h2>
<p>The Chiefs are already dealing with other significant injuries this season, including that of star running back Isiah Pacheco, who is expected to miss several weeks due to a fractured fibula. This series of setbacks raises questions about Kansas City's depth and ability to maintain its offensive effectiveness moving forward.</p>
<p>As they prepare for their Week 5 matchup against New Orleans, the Chiefs must adapt quickly while awaiting further updates on Rice's condition. The uncertainty surrounding his injury not only affects game strategy but also impacts team morale as they look to continue their undefeated start to the season.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs find themselves at a critical juncture as they navigate Rashee Rice's knee injury and its implications for their season. With key players sidelined and new challenges arising, how effectively they can adjust their offensive strategy will be vital in maintaining their competitive edge in the league. As they await more definitive news on Rice's health, both fans and teammates remain hopeful for a positive outcome.</p>1f8:{"id":109,"title":"Chiefs Face Uncertain Future After Rashee Rice's Knee Injury","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1728407214.png","content_details":"$1f9","status":null,"meta_title":"Chiefs Face Uncertain Future After Rashee Rice's Knee Injury","meta_description":"Chiefs Face Uncertain Future After Rashee Rice's Knee Injury","meta_keywords":"Chiefs Face, Future, Rashee, Knee, Injury, Sports, Sport, Game","image_alt":"Sports-Chiefs Face Uncertain Future After Rashee Rice's Knee Injury","url":"chiefs-face-uncertain-future-after-rashee-Rices-knee-injury","created_at":"2024-10-08T17:06:54.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T17:06:54.000000Z"}
1fb:T16da,<p>In games that were mostly based on thrill and spontaneity, the second week of the NFL season has delivered an enormous amount of interesting football. Ten matches were won on a single score, while four ended with game-winning points in the final moments. With such scenarios, it appeared nothing could be more exciting for the fans than the weekend of American football experienced last weekend. Four teams that missed out on the playoffs last season have opened the season at <a href="https://www.espn.in/nfl/story/_/id/41275907/nfl-week-2-2024-questions-takeaways-lessons-stats-recap-every-game"><strong>2-0</strong>,</a> which gives an indication that perhaps it might not be easy for anyone to win the league.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bengals' Struggles Continue</strong></p>
<p>It's become a telltale sign under coach <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Taylor">Zac Taylor</a></strong> that the Cincinnati Bengals start the season with a record of 0-2 for the third consecutive year. Traditionally, the Bengals do not start well since they have lost their last seven games of Week 1 and Week 2. Having had victories propel them into the playoffs in 2021 and 2022, failing to make the playoffs this season might end for Taylor.</p>
<p>Mistakes and errors in addition to failure to convert on opportunities in this very tough AFC North could be a call for massive change if they do not pick up and turn their ways sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Injuries Piling Up on the Rams</strong></p>
<p>What could be viewed as an odd twist is that the Los Angeles Rams are now being seen as the NFC West's weakest link after their loss at the hands of the Arizona Cardinals. Injuries continue to be the problem plaguing the team as Puka Nacua is going to miss several weeks and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Kupp">Cooper Kupp</a></strong> has already been photographed in a walking boot. Injuries have ravaged the offense line for the Rams, crippling them to a great degree in competing.</p>
<p>Owing to their obvious improvement, teams like the Cardinals and Seahawks don't look so farfetched at all, making it increasingly likely that the Los Angeles team will end the season at the bottom of their division.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Baltimore's Playoff Hopes Dwindling?</strong></p>
<p>For the first time since 2015, Baltimore Ravens are experiencing an uncharacteristic start with an 0-2 record. Such beginnings historically were what spelled trouble for their chances at the playoffs. But they have struggled in holding leads late in games in a promising total yards differential. The schedule moving forward doesn't look so easy, with teams like the Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills in their way.</p>
<p>However, Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh as well as quarterback Lamar Jackson have space to breathe based on their previous games and will likely find a way to muscle through this tough period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Geno Smith: Scoring Machine or All Hype?</strong></p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith has been pretty good at coming down to crunch time, but declaring him as NFL's most clutch quarterback is too early. His performance against the New England Patriots showed that he certainly is made of stuff who can lead a rally, but it is the established stars like Patrick Mahomes who are still front-runners in this narrative. Statistics speak volumes about Smith's skills; only time will tell if he shall be able to do the same on consistent basis while under pressure against elite performers.</p>
<p>Saints' Offense</p>
<p>The New Orleans Saints have asserted themselves as one of the most potent offensive machinery in the NFC, scoring an impressive 44 points against the Dallas Cowboys. The way they scored on every possession in the first half had all the makings of a team that could mushroom into something spectacular.</p>
<p>With Derek Carr at the helm and Alvin Kamara and Chris Olave doing so much of the heavy lifting in playmaking, this unit is poised to contest for conference supremacy if this level of play continues.</p>
<p>Trevor Lawrence, the quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars, has been on to another disappointing outing as his team extended its losing streak to seven games. Lawrence has been struggling, and this makes one question the status quo in relation to his being the franchise quarterback, especially after there has been some quite a substantial investment into him by the organization. With only one win since last season, and such underwhelming performances, Lawrence must step it up real fast or more criticism about his future may suffocate him in discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marvin Harrison Jr. Rookie Implication</strong></p>
<p>And just like everybody else, rookie wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr., is making early ruffles in the NFL after a notable show against the Rams, recording four catches for 130 yards and two touchdowns-all coming within the first quarter of play. That type of explosive playing suggests that he can probably go over 1,000 receiving yards this season, marking him as one who will easily eclipse franchise marks set by previous glories.</p>
<p>And so, finally it all boils down to the emergence of Harrison, and who will be among the biggest exciters for the fans of the Cardinals, but also sets the stages for an exciting year in which to see the growth.</p>
<p>As week 2 closes, unpredictability has become the theme in the NFL this year. How each team will find ways to win or cope with losing has become of paramount importance as the injury bug starts to show its head and early-season lulls in play begin to settle in, as well. The Week ahead will hold many more twists and turns as fans see how their teams will recover.</p>1fa:{"id":107,"title":"NFL Week 2: Rollercoaster Drama and Shockers","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1726551972.png","content_details":"$1fb","status":null,"meta_title":"NFL Week 2: Rollercoaster Drama and Shockers","meta_description":"NFL Week 2: Rollercoaster Drama and Shockers","meta_keywords":"NFL, Rollercoaster, Drama and Shockers, Games, Game, American football,","image_alt":"NFL Week 2: Rollercoaster Drama and Shockers","url":"nfl-week-2-rollercoaster-drama-and-shockers","created_at":"2024-09-17T05:46:12.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T05:46:12.000000Z"}
1fd:T14ca,<p>In a thrilling development at the U.S. Open, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Tiafoe">Frances Tiafoe</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.atptour.com/en/players/taylor-fritz/fb98/overview">Taylor Fritz</a></strong> have both secured spots in the semifinals, ensuring that an American man will compete in the final of the Grand Slam tournament for the first time in 18 years. This marks a significant moment for U.S. tennis, as the last time two American men reached this stage of the tournament was in 2005.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Tiafoe Advances with an Anticlimactic End</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-frances-tiafoe-reaches-semi-finals-after-grigor-dimitrov-retires-injured/articleshow/113049775.cms">Frances Tiafoe, </a><strong><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/us-open/us-open-frances-tiafoe-reaches-semi-finals-after-grigor-dimitrov-retires-injured/articleshow/113049775.cms">seeded 20th</a></strong> advanced to the semifinals after his quarterfinal opponent, Grigor Dimitrov, was forced to retire due to an injury. Tiafoe was leading 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-3, 4-1 when Dimitrov withdrew from the match just before midnight. Despite the abrupt ending, Tiafoe expressed his satisfaction at making it to the final four again. "It&rsquo;s not the way I want to get through, but I&rsquo;m happy to advance. Another semifinal here is incredible,&rdquo; Tiafoe remarked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The match itself saw some erratic play from both players. Dimitrov, who was seeded 9th, had three set points during the tiebreaker at 6-3 but faltered with consecutive double faults. Tiafoe capitalized on these errors to win the set.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Fritz's Triumph and Emotional Victory</strong></h3>
<p>Taylor Fritz, in contrast, secured his semifinal berth in a more dramatic fashion. Fritz, seeded 12th, overcame Alexander Zverev, the 4th seed, with a score of 7-6 (2), 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3). The match ended with Fritz celebrating exuberantly as Zverev's final forehand shot sailed wide. The victory marked Fritz&rsquo;s first Grand Slam semifinal appearance, a significant milestone after several near misses in previous tournaments. "Come on!&rdquo; Fritz shouted as he dropped his neon-colored racket in celebration.</p>
<p>Fritz&rsquo;s victory was characterized by his powerful serving and effective net play, winning 20 of 21 points on his first serves in the fourth set and executing 16 successful net points out of 24.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>The Upcoming American Semifinal Showdown</strong></h3>
<p>On Friday, Fritz will face Tiafoe in what promises to be an electrifying all-American semifinal. The two players, both 26 years old, have a long history together, having competed against each other since their junior tennis days. Tiafoe holds a 6-1 head-to-head advantage over Fritz in their professional encounters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the biggest match of Taylor and my lives. We&rsquo;ve known each other for so long. Playing here will be awesome,&rdquo; Tiafoe said. Fritz echoed this sentiment, acknowledging the significance of their matchup.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Context and Recent History</strong></h3>
<p>The last American men&rsquo;s semifinal at a major was in 2005 when Andre Agassi defeated Robby Ginepri at the U.S. Open. No American man has won a Grand Slam singles title since Andy Roddick's victory at the 2003 U.S. Open. Roddick was the last American to reach the U.S. Open final, losing to Roger Federer in 2006.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Dimitrov&rsquo;s Injury and Other Quarterfinals</strong></h3>
<p>Dimitrov, who has previously reached the semifinals of three major tournaments, struggled with an injury, which eventually led to his withdrawal. The Bulgarian, who experienced a physically taxing five-set match in the fourth round, was visibly hampered during the later stages of his match against Tiafoe. Dimitrov mentioned he needed to reassess his situation but did not provide specifics about his condition.</p>
<p>The remaining men&rsquo;s quarterfinals will feature top players, including No. 1 Jannik Sinner against No. 5 Daniil Medvedev, and No. 10 Alex de Minaur versus No. 25 Jack Draper.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Women&rsquo;s Semifinal Update</strong></h3>
<p>In women&rsquo;s action, No. 13 Emma Navarro of the U.S. reached her first Grand Slam semifinal by defeating No. 26 Paula Badosa with a score of 6-2, 7-5. Navarro will face No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in her next match.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><strong>Fritz&rsquo;s Path to Success</strong></h3>
<p>Fritz's previous Grand Slam quarterfinals included losses to prominent players like Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal. However, his recent performance indicates growth and improved comfort in high-stakes situations. Coach Michael Russell highlighted that past losses were not a focus before this quarterfinal, emphasizing Fritz's mindset of continual improvement. "The job&rsquo;s not done yet,&rdquo; Fritz stated, reflecting his determination and readiness for the upcoming challenges.</p>
<p>As the U.S. Open progresses, the excitement around the American semifinalists and their potential impact on the tournament continues to build.</p>1fc:{"id":105,"title":"American Tennis Stars Tiafoe and Fritz to Face Off in U.S. Open Semifinal for the First Time in Nearly Two Decades","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1725895142.png","content_details":"$1fd","status":null,"meta_title":"American Tennis Stars Tiafoe and Fritz to Face Off in U.S. Open Semifinal for the First Time in Nearly Two Decades","meta_description":"American Tennis Stars Tiafoe and Fritz to Face Off in U.S. Open Semifinal for the First Time in Nearly Two Decades","meta_keywords":"American, Tennis Stars, Tiafoe and Fritz, Semifinal, Sport, Sports, Tournament","image_alt":"American Tennis Stars Tiafoe and Fritz","url":"american-tennis-stars-tiafoe-and-fritz-to-face-off-in-us-open-semifinal-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-two-decades","created_at":"2024-09-09T15:19:02.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T15:19:02.000000Z"}
1ff:T11c5,<p>The atmosphere at the <strong><a href="https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/venues/north-paris-arena">North Paris Arena</a></strong> was electric as the U.S. women's sitting volleyball team prepared to face host nation France in a much-anticipated match during the <strong><a href="https://www.paralympic.org/paris-2024">2024 Paris Paralympic Games.</a></strong> With chants echoing from the stands, the energy was palpable even before the first serve, which was delivered as an ace by U.S. setter Alexis Shifflett-Patterson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Dominant Performance</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. team showcased their prowess on the court, delivering a commanding performance that resulted in a 3-0 victory, with set scores of 25-5, 25-1, and 25-5. The Americans racked up an impressive 28 aces and a flurry of kills, overwhelming the French team, who struggled to gain any momentum throughout the match. Despite the lopsided score, the French fans remained spirited, cheering enthusiastically for their team.</p>
<p>U.S. captain <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1172720/">Monique Matthews</a></strong> expressed her appreciation for the lively atmosphere, stating, &ldquo;I love it. I love when we play the host country because it's just surreal, just the chanting and the cheering, like the roar of it. You just can't replace it or replicate it, and I just love it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for the Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Head coach Bill Hamiter prepared his veteran squad for the intense environment they would face against France. He emphasized the importance of maintaining focus amidst the noise, a strategy that has served the team well in past competitions. Outside hitter <strong><a href="https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/emma-schieck">Emma Schieck </a></strong>echoed this sentiment, noting the excitement that comes with playing against teams that bring their best game, regardless of the crowd's support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know that every team that we play is always going to give us their best game and it makes it exciting,&rdquo; Schieck said. &ldquo;Playing with a crowd like this is, whether it's cheering for you or cheering against you, it is an absolute blast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bouncing Back from a Loss</strong></p>
<p>This match was particularly significant for the U.S. team, as they were looking to bounce back from a disappointing opening loss to China just days earlier. Historically, the Americans have faced similar challenges in previous <strong><a href="https://www.paralympic.org/paralympic-games">Paralympic Games</a></strong>, where they also lost to China in the preliminary rounds but ultimately went on to win gold. Matthews highlighted the importance of this victory for team morale, stating, &ldquo;It's always good to come out and get a win after a loss, just to build the morale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The U.S. players demonstrated resilience, quickly shaking off the loss and focusing on their next challenge. Schieck led the team with 11 kills, while Matthews and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Erickson">Heather Erickson </a></strong>contributed 10 kills each. The French team, in contrast, did not register a single ace and managed only 11 points throughout the match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>The victory against France not only served as a morale booster but also reaffirmed the U.S. team&rsquo;s status as a formidable contender in the tournament. <a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/us-womens-sitting-volleyball-team-214953422.html">Ranked No. 3</a><a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/us-womens-sitting-volleyball-team-214953422.html"> in the World ParaVolley standings, the Americans are aiming for their third consecutive gold medal. As they prepare for their next match against Italy, ranked No. 7, the team remains focused on their internal strategies rather than external competition.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hamiter&rsquo;s message to the squad moving forward is clear: maintain focus and consistency. &ldquo;It's hard, but we've been together for, I don't know, at least 10 years, the squad,&rdquo; Matthews noted. &ldquo;So we're used to it. We're really good at coming together when we need to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this strong performance behind them, the U.S. women's sitting volleyball team is poised to continue their pursuit of Paralympic glory in Paris, embodying the spirit of resilience and teamwork that has defined their journey thus far.</p>1fe:{"id":104,"title":"Team USA Dominates Host France in Paralympic Sitting Volleyball Showdown","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1725359772.png","content_details":"$1ff","status":null,"meta_title":"Team USA Dominates Host France in Paralympic Sitting Volleyball Showdown","meta_description":"Team USA Dominates Host France in Paralympic Sitting Volleyball Showdown","meta_keywords":"USA, Dominates, Host France, Paralympic, Volleyball, 2024 Paris Paralympic Games, Sport","image_alt":"Sports-News","url":"team-usa-dominates-host-france-in-paralympic-sitting-volleyball-showdown","created_at":"2024-09-03T10:36:12.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T10:36:12.000000Z"}
201:Tc76,<p>Lionel Messi, the world-renowned footballer and World Cup champion, made a significant stride in his recovery journey as he returned to practice with Inter Miami on Wednesday. This marks Messi's first public session with his teammates since sustaining a right ankle ligament injury during the Copa America final on July 14. The match, held at Hard Rock Stadium, saw Argentina clinch victory against Colombia, but it came at a cost for Messi, who was sidelined due to the injury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Milestone in Messi&rsquo;s Rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p>At 37 years old, Messi&rsquo;s return to practice is a notable milestone in his rehabilitation process. Previously, he had resumed individual drills but had yet to rejoin his Miami teammates for a full practice. Wednesday's session was a crucial step forward, demonstrating his progress as he worked alongside his fellow players on the field for the first time since his injury. The session was a mix of relief and anticipation for fans and teammates alike, signaling that Messi&rsquo;s return to form might be on the horizon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Messi&rsquo;s Absence on Inter Miami</strong></p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s injury has kept him out of Inter Miami&rsquo;s last seven games, an absence that has been felt both on and off the pitch. Despite his unavailability, the team has shown remarkable resilience and performance. Inter Miami currently leads the MLS Eastern Conference, boasting a six-point lead over second-place Cincinnati. The team has also secured a playoff spot, further underscoring their impressive season. Their recent 2-0 victory over Cincinnati highlighted their capability to thrive even in Messi&rsquo;s absence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Big Question: When Will Messi Return?</strong></p>
<p>As the MLS season approaches its final stretch, fans are eagerly speculating about Messi&rsquo;s return. Inter Miami Head Coach Tata Martino has indicated that Messi will be back before the end of the MLS season, which runs through mid-October. However, the exact timing of his return remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Inter Miami&rsquo;s upcoming fixtures include an away game against Chicago Fire FC on Saturday, which may come too soon for Messi to make his comeback. If he is not fit in time for this match, the next potential opportunity for his return would be on September 14, during a home game against the Philadelphia Union. This scheduling gives Messi additional time to fully recover, as Argentina has opted not to select him for their World Cup qualifying matches on September 5 and 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>
<p>Messi&rsquo;s gradual return to fitness is a beacon of hope for Inter Miami and its supporters. As the team continues to excel in his absence, the anticipation surrounding his return builds. The star player's presence is expected to bring a significant boost as the season progresses towards its climax. For now, fans and teammates alike will be watching closely, hoping that Messi&rsquo;s recovery will continue to advance and that he will be back on the pitch soon to contribute to Inter Miami&rsquo;s success.</p>200:{"id":103,"title":"Messi's Comeback: The Road to Recovery Begins","cat_slug":"Sports","images":"1725134050.png","content_details":"$201","status":null,"meta_title":"Messi's Comeback: The Road to Recovery Begins","meta_description":"Messi's Comeback: The Road to Recovery Begins","meta_keywords":"Messi, Footballer, Football, World Cup, Injury, Player","image_alt":"Sports- News","url":"messi-comeback-the-road-to-recovery-begins","created_at":"2024-08-31T19:54:10.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-08-31T19:54:10.000000Z"}
203:T11e1,<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Government Accountability</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">In a landmark development, the Department of Justice (DOJ) revealed on Tuesday a monumental settlement agreement totaling&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/larry-nassar-settlement-justice-department-victims-fbi-failures/">$138.7 million with victims of the disgraced former USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar.</a></strong> This settlement marks a significant step forward in addressing the victims' longstanding grievances against both Nassar and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for their respective roles in the egregious mishandling of allegations of sexual abuse.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Acknowledgment of Betrayal</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Acting Associate Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer conveyed profound regret over the reprehensible actions perpetrated by Nassar, who exploited his position of trust to perpetrate horrific acts of abuse against countless individuals. Mizer emphasized the gravity of Nassar's betrayal of trust and the urgent necessity for accountability. While the settlements cannot erase the profound trauma inflicted upon Nassar's victims, the DOJ aims to provide them with vital support to facilitate their ongoing healing processes.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Resolution of Claims</span></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;"><a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/doj-final-stages-settlement-negotiations-190000597.html"><strong>The settlement, once finalized, will resolve a staggering 139 tort claims</strong> </a></span>&nbsp;that were filed against both the DOJ and the FBI in 2022 by a significant number of athletes and patients, including prominent figures such as Maggie Nichols, Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, and McKayla Maroney. These claims, seeking approximately $1 billion in damages, arose following the DOJ's decision not to pursue criminal charges against agents implicated in the gross mishandling of Nassar's case, despite clear evidence of negligence and dereliction of duty.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Failures of Investigation</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">The damning findings of a comprehensive report issued by the DOJ's inspector general laid bare the shocking lapses in the FBI's response to reports of Nassar's heinous abuse. Despite receiving multiple notifications regarding Nassar's predatory behavior, the FBI failed to take decisive action for over 14 months, during which Nassar continued to prey upon vulnerable individuals, victimizing at least 40 more individuals in the process. Nassar's despicable crimes eventually led to convictions in 2017 and 2018, resulting in lengthy prison sentences.</span></h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Celebration and Accountability</span></strong></h4>
<h4><span style="font-family: georgia, palatino, serif;">Attorneys representing numerous claimants expressed a sense of vindication and satisfaction with the terms of the settlement, viewing it as a significant milestone in the pursuit of justice for Nassar's victims. They underscored the importance of holding both Nassar and the FBI accountable for their respective roles in perpetuating and enabling the cycle of abuse.

206:T1044,<p><strong><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl80re72zlo">A luxury cruise ship</a></strong>, the Odyssey, finally embarked on its long-awaited journey from Belfast late Monday night, marking the end of a frustrating four-month wait for its passengers. The ship's departure was celebrated with cheers and applause from those eager to begin their global adventure.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>A Night of Celebration</strong></h2>
<p>As the clock struck 22:40 GMT, passengers aboard the Odyssey erupted in joy as the vessel slipped away from Belfast harbor. Joe Martino, a 61-year-old actor from Chicago, expressed his excitement, stating, "We are going to have one heck of a time tonight; we are going to party like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow." His enthusiasm was echoed by many as they prepared to leave behind the rainy Northern Irish capital.</p>
<p>However, the ship's departure was not without its complications. Passengers faced delays at the cruise terminal due to last-minute paperwork issues that held up boarding. <strong><a href="https://mikepetersen.work/">Mike Petersen</a></strong>, CEO of <strong><a href="https://villavieresidences.com/">Villa Vie Residences</a></strong>&mdash;the company that owns the Odyssey&mdash;eventually confirmed that everything was in order for departure, prompting an outpouring of relief and joy among those waiting.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Long Wait</strong></h2>
<p>Originally scheduled to set sail on May 30 for a three-and-a-half-year cruise around the world, the Odyssey encountered numerous technical delays. The outfitting process took longer than expected, compounded by engine repairs and certification hurdles. "Everything that could go wrong went wrong," lamented Martino, summarizing the frustrations felt by many.</p>
<p>The ship underwent extensive repairs at Harland &amp; Wolff, the historic shipyard in Belfast known for constructing the Titanic over a century ago. Further complications arose when the shipbuilder entered financial administration earlier this month, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to an already tumultuous situation.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>Life in Limbo</strong></h2>
<p>During their unexpected stay in Belfast, passengers were allowed to spend their days aboard the ship but were required to find accommodations off-site for overnight stays. Many opted for local hotels or rented apartments while they awaited news of their departure. Some took advantage of their extended stay to explore Northern Ireland or venture into Europe.</p>
<p>Holly Hennessy, a passenger who brought her cat named "Captain," humorously remarked about her lengthy wait: "I&rsquo;ve been in Belfast for four months and two days, but hey, who&rsquo;s counting!" Despite the challenges, many passengers formed strong bonds during their time in Belfast and shared memorable experiences exploring the city.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>The Journey Ahead</strong></h2>
<p>With its departure now behind it, the Odyssey is set to visit an impressive array of destinations across all seven continents. The cruise will make more than 425 stops in 147 locations over its operational period. Initial ports of call include Brest and Bilbao before heading across the Atlantic towards the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The Odyssey is designed as a "residential" cruise ship where passengers can either buy or rent long-term cabins. This unique concept promises unlimited voyages around the globe, allowing travelers to experience diverse cultures and landscapes from the comfort of their floating home.</p>
<p>As passengers settled in for their first night aboard after months of waiting, there was palpable excitement about what lay ahead. Many expressed hope that this would be just the beginning of an incredible journey filled with new adventures and unforgettable memories.</p>
<p>The Odyssey's inaugural voyage is not just about travel; it represents resilience and community among those who have shared this unique experience. As they sail toward sunnier destinations, passengers are eager to embrace all that awaits them on this extraordinary cruise adventure.</p>205:{"id":110,"title":"Odyssey Cruise Ship Sets Sail After Prolonged Delay","cat_slug":"Lifestyle","images":"1728408010.png","content_details":"$206","status":null,"meta_title":"Odyssey Cruise Ship Sets Sail After Prolonged Delay","meta_description":"Odyssey Cruise Ship Sets Sail After Prolonged Delay","meta_keywords":"Odyssey cruise Ship, Sail After Prolonged Delay","image_alt":"Lifestyle- Odyssey Cruise Ship Sets Sail After Prolonged Delay","url":"odyssey-cruise-ship-sets-sail-after-prolonged-delay","created_at":"2024-10-08T17:20:10.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T17:20:10.000000Z"}
208:T17ac,<p>Researchers at <strong><a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a></strong> are making breakthrough discoveries that will significantly enhance the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Here, three landmark studies presented at the <strong><a href="https://www.esmo.org/meeting-calendar/esmo-congress-2024">ESMO Congress 2024</a></strong> in Barcelona, Spain are discussed, where issues related to the safety of breastfeeding after diagnosis and a telephone-based coaching program for promoting physical activity in patients surfaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Safety of Breastfeeding After a Breast Cancer Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p>The two studies investigated the impact of breastfeeding among young women diagnosed with breast cancer. The first study was a multicenter collaboration of research from 78 hospitals and cancer centers in 31 countries that assessed&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10518059/"> 474 patients</a></strong> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10518059/">with inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The patients had ages less than 40 years with </a>Stage I-III invasive breast cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These women were followed up for a median time of seven years after delivery. Results showed that it did not make any significant difference whether a woman had nursed or not for the recurrence of cancer. This would mean cases of cancer within the primary tumour site and the contralateral breast; therefore, it shows that breastfeeding does not increase the risk of cancer recurrences or new cancers in such patients.</p>
<p>The second study was derived from the<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8365381/"> POSITIVE trial</a></strong>, with the main objective to understand if the temporary interruption of endocrine therapy to conceive is safe in women presenting with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer. For this study, the participants included 518 women of age 42 or less, with 317 having fulfilled the definition for a live birth, and 196 opting to initiate breastfeeding. Results The outcomes of the study summarized above showed that these women could safely and feasibly breastfeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the safety only occurred in patients who had received a breast-conserving surgery. Dr. Ann Partridge, co-investigator of the two studies, stressed that these findings were greatly significant, providing crucial evidence that breastfeeding is indeed possible for younger survivors of breast cancer. In her statement, "Our findings highlight the potential to support maternal and infant needs without compromising maternal safety," referring to the significance of both maternal health and infant care needs have to be attended to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging Physical Exercise through Coaching</strong></p>
<p>Improving Overweight Breast Cancer Survivors' Levels of Physical Activity Using a <strong><a href="https://society.asco.org/about-asco/press-center/news-releases/telephone-based-coaching-intervention-leads-weight-loss">Telephone-Based Coaching Program: BWEL</a></strong> Trial In the third study, we aimed to improve overweight breast cancer survivors' levels of physical activity through a telephone-based coaching program. This study took place within the Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) trial, where we were interested in understanding whether there was any potential for structured weight loss interventions to decrease risks of cancer recurrence among women whose BMI fell into the overweight and obese categories.</p>
<p>3,180 women were randomly assigned to either of two groups. In one group, phone-based coaching aimed at lowering caloric intake and increasing exercise; in the second group, health education materials alone were provided. The baseline measurements are revealing as it presents that intervention arm women are largely inactive and, after six months, increased their average weekly exercise by as much as 40 minutes. Control group: The level of physical activity was not increased at any point in time.</p>
<p>The findings also showed that the subjects who had at least 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity were losing more weight as compared to those that were not. Dr. <strong><a href="https://www.dana-farber.org/find-a-doctor/jennifer-a-ligibel">Jennifer Ligobel</a></strong>, a researcher of this study, noted that "a telephone-based weight loss intervention can stimulate this group of patients into being more active." The present study is expected to determine whether such increases in physical activity will translate into better cancer outcomes over a longer term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Future Research and Patient Care</strong></p>
<p>Together, they outline a critical step forward in the understanding of how lifestyle choices after diagnosis of cancer might themselves modify survivorship. The safety of breastfeeding by young mothers after diagnosis of breast cancer may reassure many women wrestling with agonizing decisions about motherhood after treatment. Also, effective interventions, such as telephone-based coaching, may empower patients to take greater control over their health, being more active physically and managing weight better.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the long term, further insight will be developed from observation of these patients by researchers on how lifestyle changes could improve general outcome in health for breast cancer survivors. Implications may unlock avenues to include supportive measures in standard care for the woman who navigates the 'aftermath of treatment' for breast cancer.</p>
<p>And so, in conclusion, these pioneering studies by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute not only give breast cancer survivors who are young pieces of mind concerning breastfeeding but equally remind the society of innovative approaches to improve their well-being through structured support programs.</p>207:{"id":108,"title":"Breakthrough Studies Bring New Hope to Breast Cancer Survivors","cat_slug":"Lifestyle","images":"1726553122.png","content_details":"$208","status":null,"meta_title":"Breakthrough Studies Bring New Hope to Breast Cancer Survivors","meta_description":"Breakthrough Studies Bring New Hope to Breast Cancer Survivors","meta_keywords":"Studies, Hope, Breast Cancer, Survivors, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, breastfeed, breastfeeding, Lifestyle, Physical Activity","image_alt":"Breakthrough Studies Bring New Hope to Breast Cancer Survivors","url":"breakthrough-studies-bring-new-hope-to-breast-cancer-survivors","created_at":"2024-09-17T06:05:22.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T06:05:22.000000Z"}

20c:Td04,<h4>Amidst the glitz and glamour showcased on social media, former child actor Robby Clark's real estate empire, intertwined with corporations owning a staggering $144 million, faces the harsh reality of financial distress. The ostentatious display of luxury, featuring private jets, yachts, and star-studded parties, contrasted sharply with the crumbling business foundation.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Clark, along with business partners Dylan Suitor, Ryan Molony, and Aruba Butt, amassed hundreds of properties across Ontario, yet their opulent lifestyle masked mounting debt and unpaid bills. Despite the facade, court documents reveal a desperate struggle to keep up with loan payments and property maintenance.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As the spotlight dims on their extravagant escapades, the unraveling of their empire sheds light on a web of financial mismanagement and dubious lending practices. Their downfall serves as a cautionary tale of the perils of unchecked ambition and unsustainable growth in the real estate sector.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Robby Clark's journey from child actor to real estate magnate was marked by financial turbulence. Bankruptcy in 2009 was followed by failed business ventures, paving the way for his foray into real estate. However, his lack of financial literacy and reliance on others to secure loans laid the groundwork for future troubles.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Clark's corporation, SID Developments, alongside entities owned by Suitor, Molony, and Butt, embarked on a rapid acquisition spree, buoyed by loans arranged by mortgage broker Claire Drage. Drage's ties to private lenders facilitated a staggering number of loans, totaling over 1,300, fueling the empire's expansion.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Yet, beneath the veneer of success lay a crumbling foundation. Despite generating substantial rental income, the corporations struggled to meet debt obligations, resulting in a cascade of defaults and mounting lawsuits. The dream of vast wealth and billion-dollar holdings gave way to the harsh reality of insolvency.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The fallout from SID Developments' financial woes extends far beyond boardroom battles. In cities like Sault Ste. Marie, where the corporation owns a significant portion of the housing stock, the impact on tenants and communities is profound.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>With hundreds of properties in disrepair and mounting tax arrears, tenants face uncertainty and displacement. Local authorities grapple with property standard violations and unpaid taxes, exacerbating tensions between the corporation and the community.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Amidst the chaos, potential buyers like Core Developments offer a glimmer of hope, pledging to limit tenant displacement and restore stability. However, the specter of eviction looms large, casting a shadow over the fate of vulnerable renters caught in the crossfire of corporate collapse.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>As the saga unfolds, it serves as a stark reminder of the pitfalls of unchecked greed and the need for greater oversight in the real estate industry. While the allure of wealth and luxury may dazzle, the consequences of financial mismanagement reverberate far and wide, leaving a trail of broken dreams and shattered lives in its wake.</h4>20b:{"id":79,"title":"Real Estate Tycoons' Lavish Lifestyle Masks Financial Woes","cat_slug":"Lifestyle","images":"1707845313.png","content_details":"$20c","status":null,"meta_title":"Real Estate Tycoons' Lavish Lifestyle Masks Financial Woes","meta_description":"Real Estate Tycoons' Lavish Lifestyle Masks Financial Woes","meta_keywords":"Lifestyle, Real Estate, Financial","image_alt":"Real Estate Tycoons' Lavish Lifestyle Masks Financial Woes","url":"real-estate-Tycoons-lavish-lifestyle-masks-financial-woes","created_at":"2024-02-13T17:28:33.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-02-13T17:28:33.000000Z"}

210:Taa6,<p>Andrew Boyd, a 23-year-old YouTuber from Chattanooga, Tennessee, embarked on a 75-day journey to test millionaire Bryan Johnson's controversial age-reversing lifestyle, which involves the Blueprint diet and biohacking. Johnson, a 46-year-old tech mogul, has gained notoriety for his extreme dietary and lifestyle practices in his pursuit of longevity, including blood swapping with family members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew was inspired by Johnson's approach and decided to follow the Blueprint diet and document his experiences on his YouTube channel, Project Andrew. He noted significant results throughout the experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After just a week on the Blueprint diet, Andrew reported feeling "incredible" and lost an average of six pounds. His sleep quality also improved significantly, with an average sleep score of 95 percent, motivating him to continue the regimen for a total of 75 days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Johnson's lifestyle reportedly costs around $2 million per year, Andrew, not being a millionaire tech mogul, made some adjustments. He used recipes from Johnson's website, selected specific vitamins, and spent approximately $112.34 per week on food and supplements, in addition to four hours per week on meal prep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The results of Andrew's experiment were impressive. He lost nearly 30 pounds, reduced his body fat percentage from 19 percent to 13.9 percent, and felt more focused and energized. He emphasized that the Blueprint lifestyle isn't just about diet or specific practices but revolves around data-driven health choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Andrew also pointed out some concerns, including the impact of calorie deficits on hormones and the complexity of Johnson's multifaceted approach. He encouraged others following the Blueprint lifestyle to share their data to determine its effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryan Johnson, who has invested millions in health initiatives, aims to achieve optimal health and longevity through rigorous monitoring and interventions, such as advanced medical testing and dietary practices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the benefits, Andrew acknowledged that prioritizing health to the extent Johnson does can be incredibly challenging, especially in a world where such practices are far from the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson's pursuit of eternal youth includes regular health measurements and interventions, and he claims to have the heart of a 37-year-old, the skin of a 28-year-old, and the fitness levels of an 18-year-old. His journey into longevity has garnered attention and intrigue, as well as questions about the feasibility and sustainability of such extreme measures.</p>20f:{"id":67,"title":"YouTuber Tests Millionaire Bryan Johnson's Age-Reversing Lifestyle","cat_slug":"Lifestyle","images":"1697024634.png","content_details":"$210","status":null,"meta_title":"YouTuber Tests Millionaire Bryan Johnson's Age-Reversing Lifestyle","meta_description":"YouTuber Tests Millionaire Bryan Johnson's Age-Reversing Lifestyle","meta_keywords":"YouTuber, Millionaire Bryan Johnson's Age-Reversing, Lifestyle,","image_alt":"YouTuber Tests Millionaire Bryan Johnson's Age-Reversing Lifestyle","url":"youtuber-tests-millionaire-bryan-johnsons-age-reversing-lifestyle","created_at":"2023-10-11T11:43:54.000000Z","updated_at":"2024-01-11T07:01:19.000000Z"}
212:T849,<p>After discovering his elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease, actor Chris Hemsworth, known for his role as "Thor," has embarked on significant lifestyle changes to prioritize his health.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hemsworth, aged 40, now incorporates more solitude and mindfulness into his life, recognizing the importance of taking time for oneself without external distractions. He has always been committed to regular exercise but now places a stronger emphasis on stillness and mindfulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I do a lot of meditation and breathwork, mostly during sauna and ice bath routines," he revealed. Hemsworth finds that immersive physical activities like surfing force him to be fully present, moving his focus from his mind to his body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The revelation of Hemsworth's heightened Alzheimer's risk came in November during his Disney+ series, "Limitless," in a conversation with longevity physician Dr. Peter Attia. Hemsworth learned that he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which is strongly associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, Hemsworth has taken several steps to prioritize his health:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Improved Sleep Patterns: He focuses on consistent sleep routines, limiting screen time an hour before bedtime, and opting for reading to unwind. Additionally, he works on detaching from every thought and observing mental chatter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adapted Fitness Routine: Hemsworth has adjusted his fitness regimen to incorporate more cardio and endurance workouts, moving away from heavy bodybuilding-style sessions. This change aligns with his evolving health goals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

214:T5cf,<p>The era of the "girlboss" as a symbol of empowerment and success is waning, giving way to a new trend known as the "snail girl." Gen Z, often described as the generation with a unique perspective on work and life, is at the forefront of this shift, emphasizing a slower-paced life focused on self-care and happiness rather than relentless ambition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The term "snail girl" was coined by Sienna Ludbey, a designer and founder of Hello Sisi, in her article titled "'Snail girl era': Why I'm slowing down and choosing to be happy rather than busy." Ludbey shared her transformation from a "girlboss" who felt pressured to appear continuously successful to someone who values purpose and contentment more than societal expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an age where burnout has become a prevalent issue, particularly among young professionals, Gen Z is reevaluating the traditional notion of success tied to relentless work. The "snail girl" takes life at her own pace, focused on creating and enjoying the journey, regardless of the fast-paced world around her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of the "girlboss" has faced scrutiny in recent years as young individuals grapple with the idea that they must constantly improve or change themselves to succeed in the workplace. Michelle P. King, an expert in diversity and inclusion, argues that these ideas are inherently problematic as they imply that women must conform to male-dominated workplace norms.</p>213:{"id":55,"title":"Gen Z Embraces the 'Snail Girl' Lifestyle: Prioritizing Self-Care Over Hustle Culture","cat_slug":"Lifestyle","images":"1697018045.png","content_details":"$214","status":null,"meta_title":"Gen Z Embraces the 'Snail Girl' Lifestyle: Prioritizing Self-Care Over Hustle Culture","meta_description":"Gen Z Embraces the 'Snail Girl' Lifestyle: Prioritizing Self-Care Over Hustle Culture","meta_keywords":"Lifestyle, empowerment, success,","image_alt":"Gen Z Embraces the 'Snail Girl' Lifestyle: Prioritizing Self-Care Over Hustle Culture","url":"gen-z-embraces-the-snail-girl-lifestyle-prioritizing-self-care-over-hustle-culture","created_at":"2023-10-11T09:54:05.000000Z","updated_at":"2023-10-11T09:54:05.000000Z"}

217:T2656,<p>Dating apps dominate the world. Most feel swamped by all the swipes and connections made superficially. In such a world, searching for that meaningful relationship is like finding a needle in a haystack. This is where <strong>Selective Search </strong>comes in as a luxury matchmaking firm. They redefine the journey to love through a personalized, professional approach.</p>
<p>Founded in 2000 by Barbie Adler, Selective Search has proven to be the country's premier matchmaking service, as its professional staff have combined for more than 150 years of experience. The company utilizes its proprietary process, Meet Your Future, which synthesizes insights from executive search, psychology, and sociology to tailor a match specifically for the client. Over 4,000 couples have been brought together by this revolutionary approach, with an impressive success rate of 87%, through the happy couples.</p>
<p>What makes Selective Search different is its focus on long-term relationships. Unlike other dating applications that focus on casual connections, this company aims to ensure that clients find their life partners. It carefully crafts every match so that people mesh with each other's preferences and lifestyles&mdash;no more anonymous profiles in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Confidentiality at Selective Search is an absolute priority. The company knows that keeping confidentiality means a lot for the kind of clients with busy schedules who might need secrecy in their daily lives. For more than two decades now, the firm has made sure to have a 'behind the scenes' approach without exposing a client's secret while managing to deliver successful results that matter.</p>
<p>Investing in Selective Search is investment in a future full of love and happiness. Offering professional service tailored to the meaningful connection of people with each other, this firm can be said to provide transformative experiences while searching for that true love. As most people have flings now, Selective Search would be considered the beacon that shines out at the end.</p>
<p><strong>The Philosophy Behind Selective Search</strong></p>
<p>Barbie Adler is the founder and president of Selective Search. Raised by a family psychologist as a mother, Barbie has always had an extraordinary comprehension of human connections. In fact, her mother introduced her to many concepts about psychology and interpersonal relations, discussing them at times when she was still little.</p>
<p>For instance, she attended various conferences and followed publications like Psychology Today since childhood. Her journey into matchmaking was a career in public relations followed by an executive search; during this time, she learned skills important for matching people with appropriate opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She saw an opportunity to merge her expertise in executive search with a passion for helping others find love and founded Selective Search. By combining professional matchmaking with executive search strategies, Barbie created a service that filled a gap in the market for those seeking high-end, personalized searches for love.</p>
<p><strong>Building Selective Search</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search is a reflection of Barbie Adler's commitment to creating meaningful relationships among elite professionals. Recognizing a need for a matchmaking service tailored toward the lifestyles of accomplished people, she focused on a solution for singles overlooked by mainstream dating platforms. Most busy professionals do not have the time or resources to look for a compatible partner; many feel underserved by generic dating applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was through Selective Search that Barbie offered a service where executive search techniques were repurposed for personal matchmaking. Her approach not only caters to the special needs of these extraordinary singles but also prioritizes individualized experience to support her clients in finding love in the long term. For more than 25 years, this model has positively transformed thousands of clients' lives.</p>
<p><strong>The Winning Formula of Selective Search</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search has achieved an unmatched success rate in matchmaking under the leadership of Barbie Adler. The proprietary approach features understanding the unique vision of each client for a successful relationship. From day one, the Selective Search team creates "Benchmarks for Success&trade;", structured and measurable goals throughout the search process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This disciplined methodology has brought Selective Search to a position of being the preeminent boutique matchmaking company in the nation since the company's inception in the year 2000. With over 4,000 couples matched, expressions of thanks have poured from clients through wedding photos and family announcements. Barbie thoroughly enjoys seeing her clients with happiness, knowing her staff has helped create lasting links and legacies.</p>
<p><strong>The Proprietary Approach of Selective Search</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search is a company dedicated to making the dream of true love a reality. Singles find each other in the company's highly personalized matchmaking process. The collective experience between staff members amounts to more than 150 years. Its digs are deeper than usual dating profiles to unveil every client's unique preferences and values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dedicated matchmakers will then pair these clients with supportive and personalized coaching. Selective Search goes beyond the provision of compatible matches; it ensures that every client makes a real, meaningful connection. With over 250,000 singles in an exclusive network who have been prescreened, clients experience a balance of strict selection and customized matchmaking to zero in on their future while maximizing compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Client Safety</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search does tons of work in areas of privacy and security, showing the client how much trust is communicated in the matchmaking process. There are extensive background checks and reputation analysis before ever proposing someone with these issues on a rapport basis that ensures their confidentiality and gives them peace of mind. Client anonymity is respected all through their search with secure processes having a discrete approach in love exploration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this broad approach, integrity and privacy are maximized while finding a compatible partner, as the process is both safe and enjoyable. Through this careful, client-centered model, Selective Search remains committed to forming authentic relationships while providing high standards of confidentiality and security.</p>
<p><strong>The Six-Step Process</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search's Meet Your Future TM method melds together executive search techniques with proprietary matchmaking processes to create a seamless, efficient experience. This six step methodology, designed based on observations of psychology and sociology with elements of the conventional executive search and match, is still novel to strive at better results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective Search handpicks its clients, as they not only fit the bill but share with the firm those values that constitute the core of the mission in assisting people in their quest for perfect matches for all the right reasons.</p>
<p>Since the firm can execute search after search all through one thorough consultation, you are sure of having the match perfect, and such a match should be based on deep criteria, not on surface measures. They will fine-tune each match by requesting private feedback after every date to make sure that all connections are meaningful and directed to the relationship goals that clients have.</p>
<p><strong>Industry Trends</strong></p>
<p>As expectations by clients and norms within society change, Selective Search remains sensitive to trends such as AI and predictive technologies being advanced in the matchmaking business. While these technologies bring value, Selective Search stays true to its personal touch that defines it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company infuses the latest technology into meeting client expectations where it can add value to the client experience but retains their hallmark personal approach. As niche matchmaking becomes increasingly in demand, Selective Search has also added niche services catering to specific tastes and demographics, which further cements its commitment to the satisfaction of clients and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Investing in Expertise</strong></p>
<p>Selective Search invests much in the professional development of its matchmakers to ensure they are relationship coaching experts and dating trend experts. The client can thus be assured that guidance and advice will be up-to-date. Selective Search extends beyond just matchmaking in a network of experts in health, wellness, and lifestyle. This personalized service provides clients with the best tools for a successful and potentially fulfilling experience, making Selective Search stand out as unmatched support.</p>
<p><strong>Excellence in Elite Matchmaking</strong></p>

Authentic living may have never been more urgent in the cacophony of noise that surrounds lives. <strong>RealSpot </strong>is perhaps the most refreshing app about empowering users to take ownership of their own narrative&mdash;recording their lives in all simplicity.</p>
<p>RealSpot is a kind of online version of the roll film camera where people can take almost instant pictures of their favorite places without thinking about cropping or deleting the overthought moments. This way, it lets people live in the moment and keep memories, as well as connect with other people. Using RealSpot, individuals can create their own collection of "REAL" photos of their lives and build profiles of the locally preferred businesses as well.</p>
<p>Under the helm is <strong>Suzanne Martin</strong>, <strong>CEO, </strong>who is sharply passionate about changing how we relate to our memories as well as the world at large. Just when the disposable cameras became cool, RealSpot frees a user from traditional social anxiety and self-doubts. It is actual spontaneity that puts its emphasis on what is of key interest to users&mdash;such as the ability to help build communities and live life as if it really happens.</p>
<p>The app has a lively "vibes page" where people can find new hotspots and share their experiences with others. While recording their trips, they not only save their memories but also help the survival of local businesses, which is important for the life of the community. RealSpot is thus a bright spot of positivity in these uncertain times that urges people to be themselves and uplift the people around them.</p>
<p><strong>Journey from Artist to Tech Visionary</strong></p>
<p>For Suzanne Martin, CEO of RealSpot, the path from artist to tech entrepreneur is paved by creativity, love for humanity, and a transformative approach to social media. For her, artistic expression merged with a vision of change, which led to building RealSpot as an authentic platform that values honesty above traditional social media metrics.</p>
<p>Looking back at my childhood, my artistic life had shaped the path of my life. My first few steps off mainstream social media led to a realization of the limitations of validation and comparison that online creates. Suzanne reveals how, as an artist, "my expression found depth in lyrics embedded in abstract art," pointing out that music opened ways for emotional connection. This led to the realization of RealSpot&mdash;the place where moments are snapped and voiced by song lyric expressions beyond mere words.</p>
<p>As RealSpot began to stretch its wings, Suzanne based the value of her firm on the integration of artistic authenticity and technology. Suzanne dreamed of a social website that could capture the very soul of every moment music brings with it in a manner that would share meaningful relationships between users and others. "Imagine this, a memory captured within a song, beyond an ordinary caption," Suzanne thought. An idea became full-fledged, an entirely new ecosystem that redefines the very core of the essence of social media.</p>
<p><strong>Navigating Social Media with a Focus on Authenticity</strong></p>
<p>As RealSpot expanded, Suzanne ventured into uncharted territories, discovering the intricate workings of the business model on social media. RealSpot was no longer a photo-sharing app but an authentic social platform focusing on community engagement and local business support. Suzanne reimagined the features of RealSpot, moving from likes and comments to a more authentic user experience. "We wanted to redefine social media," she states. "We learned from our peers in the industry and designed something uniquely ours."</p>
<p>Given this focus on true community engagement, all things in the app that were seen as creating social media fatigue got eliminated. The main attraction at RealSpot is genuine user interaction aimed at enhancing personal and community connection. Suzanne's design supports and encourages a wholesome, meaningful online presence wherein users truly live the world, free from the mediative lens of filtering.</p>
<p><strong>Building Community-Centric Values</strong></p>
<p>There are four guiding principles at the heart of RealSpot's mission: people as influencers, using locals as a source to get recommendations, music serving as the glue that is going to tie it up, and cash incentives as some form of a reward mechanism. Suzanne feels that, as a marketplace, this is three-sided user-generated content where community tie-in is bound through connection with local businesses. The speaker details that each photograph tells three stories at three different locations and how RealSpot refashioned the same photograph to be a personal memory, a public feed, and a vibe-curated page to enhance local involvement.</p>
<p>It puts the community front and center. Because the company focuses on a neighborhood or local business location when creating personal galleries, this new business model empowers small businesses to identify and locate customers in an unprecedented, dynamic form of interaction that turns its users into advocates for commerce in their locality. By emphasizing ties to the community as well as to local culture, RealSpot provides business companies with a refreshing route from mainstream social advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Authenticity Meets Responsible Technology</strong></p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s emphasis on unfiltered, real-life moments aligns with its tech-forward philosophy. Suzanne explains, "Our users find value in sharing their experiences without altering their images." By sidestepping filters and avoiding features that encourage heavy editing, RealSpot champions a responsible use of technology that values honesty. Suzanne emphasizes this commitment: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about fostering connections through our true selves&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s a local coffee shop or a hidden gem on the map.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s mapping feature is designed to connect users with their surrounding businesses in real-time. Partnered businesses pay for enhanced map visibility, allowing them to offer special promotions like &ldquo;25% off&rdquo; that appear directly on users&rsquo; screens. This feature encourages users to discover local venues, reinforcing the app&rsquo;s role in supporting small businesses and building community ties.</p>
<p><strong>The Local Impact</strong></p>
<p>In Sayulita, a coastal town in Mexico, RealSpot&rsquo;s impact has been transformative. Suzanne recalls meeting a vibrant local woman braiding hair on the beach&mdash;a friendship that illustrated the app&rsquo;s potential. Suzanne helped this small business owner showcase her skills on RealSpot, allowing her to move from handwritten bookings to a thriving business model, all through the app&rsquo;s real-time location sharing.</p>
<p>This local success story became a model for RealSpot&rsquo;s impact on small businesses. By focusing on everyday interactions and connections, Suzanne empowers users to highlight the unique elements of their communities. Her experiences in Sayulita reflect RealSpot&rsquo;s core mission: a platform that strengthens community bonds by giving voice to small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>A New Era of Influencer Marketing</strong></p>
<p>RealSpot&rsquo;s upcoming launch in Knoxville, Tennessee, signifies a step forward in modern influencer marketing. As Suzanne outlines, RealSpot&rsquo;s "spotters,&rdquo; or influencers, will soon have the opportunity to earn rewards for their local engagement. The phased launch introduces rewards for visiting local businesses, allowing influencers to participate fairly in the app&rsquo;s growing community.</p>
<p>Suzanne&rsquo;s innovative approach to influencer marketing doesn&rsquo;t seek to replace traditional methods but rather supplements them with authenticity. By enabling spotters to engage with multiple businesses and earn, Suzanne hopes to provide a platform that celebrates local influencers, staying true to RealSpot&rsquo;s mission of highlighting community connections and everyday experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Paving the Way for Global Localized Engagement</strong></p>
<p>Suzanne envisions a future where RealSpot becomes a local community platform for towns around the world. With its unique model, RealSpot provides users with real-time insights on businesses and places within their zip code. Suzanne believes this can shift economic power into the hands of communities themselves, bridging local and digital economies in a revolutionary way.</p>
<p>Unlike typical social platforms, RealSpot is built to complement rather than compete, incorporating advances made since the early days of social media. Suzanne likens this evolution to the innovation in cooking or technology&mdash;where progress doesn't negate the past but builds upon it. RealSpot&rsquo;s trajectory is one that aims to revitalize and transform the digital landscape, inspired by a respect for community and culture.</p>
<p><strong>The Woman Behind RealSpot</strong></p>
<p>Resilience and vision defined the journey of an artist turned CEO&mdash;Suzanne Martin, a true New Jersey native&mdash;who beats Silicon Valley odds by creating RealSpot and continues the beat. Deemed the "Elle Woods of Silicon Valley," the brand Technically Blonde is the backbone for RealSpot and more ventures in development.</p>
<p>From volunteering in her community to raising her children, Suzanne's impact reaches far beyond her business. Her story, forged in a perfect blend of tenacity and creative spirit, inspires women in tech and beyond. Clearly, it is her mission to solve world problems through innovation, both determined and authentic. As she puts it, "Creating RealSpot was never about competition&mdash;it's about making the world more connected, one community at a time.".</p>21d:T2a2e,<p>In a technology-driven world, artificial intelligence is the greatest challenge before integrating technology into life.

Many grapple with outdated systems that hinder growth and complicate operations. Meet <strong>Nihan Yolga</strong>, <strong>Co-Founder</strong> and <strong>COO </strong>of <strong>Forceget Supply Chain Logistics</strong>, who is revolutionizing the logistics domain with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Forceget began its journey as an international logistics company focused on supporting eCommerce B2B sellers. However, Nihan and her co-founder, <em>Burak Yolga</em>, envisioned something greater from the start. They recognized the pressing need for a logistics provider that not only moved goods but also empowered businesses with complete oversight of their supply chain operations. This vision has materialized into a robust, AI-powered digital platform that transcends traditional logistics.</p>
<p>With a presence spanning four continents&mdash;North America, South America, Europe, and Asia, Forceget offers comprehensive end-to-end supply chain solutions. The platform integrates advanced management tools with logistics services, enabling businesses to streamline operations from one central hub. Features like Instant Quotes, Real-time Tracking, and Inventory Management simplify processes that once seemed daunting.</p>

As she leads Forceget into the future, her vision continues to inspire a new era of logistics, one where complexity is simplified and businesses thrive through enhanced operational efficiency.</p>
<p><em>Let us learn more about her journey:</em></p>
<p><strong>The Vision</strong></p>
<p>The company, Forceget Supply Chain Logistics, is built upon the collective experience of its founders, Burak and Nihan Yolga. CEO and Co-Founder Burak spent seven magical years in China, where he fully confronted and immersed himself in the logistics world.</p>
<p>This exposure granted him a profound appreciation for the operating systems and threw light on inefficiencies that most businesses face while striving to deal with the intricacies of supply chains. Inspired by this experience, he ventured to design a solution that makes operations easy and allows companies to be more in control of their logistics systems.</p>
<p>The COO and Co-Founder Nihan has relevant industry experience due to her work experience for several years as the Head of Digital Innovation for Borusan Holding and applies that experience. She has such direct experience with what technology can do to traditional industries that she applies her knowledge in digitizing how logistics operations are conducted. They founded Forceget as an international logistics company providing air, ocean, and truck shipping services and a comprehensive supply chain solution provider.</p>
<p>Their mission was to bring in much-needed transparency into an industry that's often mysterious&mdash;an industry where customers have long been concerned about reduced visibility in their shipments and procedures. The platform by Forceget uses the most advanced AI and digital tools to integrate a comprehensive supply chain solution that gives businesses real-time visibility into every aspect of their logistics and inventory operations.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Burak and Nihan, Forceget continues to redefine industry standards. Indeed, a customer-centric solution like this one does not only bring complexity down but also grows more through the thorough nurturing of businesses in the midst of navigating the intricate world that is supply chain logistics.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming Supply Chain Management</strong></p>
<p>Forceget's AI technology moves from reactionary action towards proactive data-informed strategies for supply chain management. It applies predictive modeling in sales trend forecasting and optimizes demand planning with pinpointed lead times. This way, clients avoid unnecessary stockouts, maintain lean inventories, and then help make running operations that are relatively streamlined and cost-effective while being focused on growth.</p>
<p>A lot of success stories in terms of Forceget AI technology are illustrations of its solid capabilities. The client was facing an inability to honor demand from its customers during peak seasons due to persistent stockouts. With the aid of the predictive tools at Forceget, it was able to analyze historical sales data to gain accurate knowledge of demand patterns. This foresight would allow the client to top up the right inventory levels just when it is needed and improve the overall stock levels of the client. Through such arrangements, they were able to eliminate stock outs while improving their fulfillment rate and exposing better customer satisfaction. This led to increased revenues.</p>
<p>Beyond just managing inventory, Forceget offers an AI-enabled pricing model, offering real-time quotations for air, ocean, and truck shipments. This function eliminates the lag involved in a business's decision-making process to render it agile enough to survive in the face of stiff competition.</p>
<p>The full force of technology from Forceget manages the edge of the supply chain&mdash;from forecasting to fulfillment&mdash;whisking along with smooth functionality, ensuring businesses operate at peak efficiency and effectiveness in today's fast-paced environment.</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Tracking Solutions for Modern Logistics</strong></p>
<p>Through strategic partnerships with key industry players, Forceget has established a reliable tracking system where smooth operations prevail with little hindrance. Initially, the focus lay in the development of a mighty platform that could unite all these transportation modes together: sea, air, truck, and small parcel shipments, hence fulfilling the promise of precise, real-time tracking of customers through the entire supply chain.</p>
<p>The real-time shipment visibility gives not only the current status but also the changes in ETA and ETD. This feature further arms businesses with the power of informed decision-making, thus facilitating smooth operation. Therefore, by giving its customers real-time data accessibility, Forceget ensures that the customer is always in the know-how regarding the logistics process; the risk of uncertainty is reduced and the process becomes easier.</p>
<p>Emphasis on transparency and continuous tracking serves instead to strengthen the bond between Forceget and its clients, outfitting them with the information and control needed to aggressively expand without knowledge of an unexpected problem that would suddenly come barging into their business.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of the Customer Cockpit</strong></p>
<p>The "Customer Cockpit" is indeed a marvellous innovation of user experience, allowing clients to have a unified overview and complete control over their entire supply chain from one very easy-to-use interface. In this way, such a centralized system simplifies complicated logistics activities in that the users can easily trace shipments, monitor inventories, and receive instantaneous data without having to juggle through separate tools or systems.</p>
<p>Other than that, most clients are satisfied with what they have in place at the moment. Many have pointed out that, through the Customer Cockpit, they are now finally better structured and wasting less time in manual tasks&mdash;the overall efficiency therefore gets boosted. Navigation is user-friendly; users love it, and a whole lot of insights are available to them on the dashboard.</p>
<p>This empowerment no longer simplifies the workflow but frees them to concentrate on strategic growth initiatives rather than being mired in administrative duties. With the holistic solution, Forceget continues to improve the experience of logistics and promotes customers navigating this extremely competitive market with confidence and agility.</p>
<p><strong>Transforming Supply Chain Management with Data Analytics</strong></p>
<p>Forceget leads in the realm of supply chain optimization and puts advanced data analytics to work improving the operational efficacy of clients. For instance, it is about efficiency improvements by just eradicating inefficiencies and cost-cutting, which enable businesses to feel confident about navigating their supply chains.</p>
<p>Forceget applies AI-powered technology in examining large datasets thoroughly, hence extracting valuable trends for forecasting demand and also lead time evaluation. This predictive modeling enables the clients to estimate the velocity of sales so that they can maintain optimum inventory levels and avoid pitfalls of stockouts. By automating the replenishment and inventory management processes, Forceget is able to enable clients to avoid excess stock, holding costs, and lost sales due to inventories that could not meet demand.</p>
<p>One great innovation that has been executed by Forceget is the use of AI-based pricing models to give quotes for air, ocean, and truck in the shortest time possible. This basically eliminates wait times that would otherwise be spent, enabling a client to make swift, cost-effective decisions that further improve their operational efficiency.</p>
<p>By utilizing data analytics, Forceget identifies points of weakness for a supply chain and gives the client the insight to make choices that propel productivity. In the final instance, Forceget converts supply chain management into a strategic leverage point for businesses so that they can adapt their business model with ease in any landscape of rapidly changing markets.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledging AI for Enhanced Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is going to revolutionize both supply chain management and logistics services through unprecedented levels of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. With AI-powered predictive analytics, organizations are now able to come up with the revolution of demand forecasting to enable real-time inventory management that largely reduces overstocking and stockout problems.</p>
<p>With AI automation in warehouses, the crucial processes of sorting, picking, and packing for order fulfillment are also faster and more accurate. At Forceget, on the forefront of this technological change, the team is a practically active user of AI to advance their platform for the users. They use sophisticated machine algorithms to analyze historically what has happened, seasonal trends, and conditions in the market to draw credible demand forecasts. This proactive strategy ensures optimal stock levels, reduces holding costs, and effectively mitigates the risk of stockouts.</p>
<p>Further, the pricing strategy of Forceget utilizes AI to update rates in real-time and as and when changes take place in demands and market dynamics. This would not only upgrade their service packaging but also make agility possible for their customers through navigating the very dynamically changed market. Thus, with these innovations, Forceget sets a new benchmark in logistics service and shows how smart applications in technology can lead to greater efficiency and agility in the supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>Elevating Efficiency in Warehousing</strong></p>
<p>Forceget realizes that the true operational strategy would be to have efficiency in warehousing. By site positioning of these facilities on both the east and west coasts, it puts the company in a better position competitively in the transport aspects. Geographical location aside from saving time in transit also saves the clients a lot since costs are dropped.</p>
<p>Forceget adopts a number of effective steps in making it more efficient within its warehouses. Advanced inventory management is the first step, involving the real-time tracking and organization of the stock. Quick retrieval to ensure that order needs are met produces timely satisfaction of the needs of customers. Checking on the level of inventory with a turnover rate is also addressed using data analytics to enable proactive replenishment and minimize excess stock.</p>
<p>Equally, the company's facilities are fitted with cutting-edge automation technologies that allow for the streamlining of sorting and packing. Through this technology integration, orders become fulfilled with a higher degree of both speed and accuracy, thus contributing to a more efficient operation in general. In such meticulous strategies, Forceget is continually perfecting its approach towards warehousing: always responsive to client needs, always operational excellence.</p>

<p>For decades, statins have been the go-to medications for managing high LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and reducing cardiovascular risk. While statins have proven benefits, they also carry potential side effects that some patients can't tolerate.</p>
<p>"We're transforming the treatment of cardiovascular disease for millions of patients," says Sheldon Koenig, President and CEO. &ldquo;In the battle against heart disease, the biotech <strong>Esperion </strong>is pioneering an innovative new approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Esperion was founded in 2008 by Dr. Roger Newton, who had a pioneering idea&mdash;to develop a safe, effective cholesterol-lowering drug that didn't carry the negative side effects associated with standard statin medications. That concept gave rise to bempedoic acid, an ACLY inhibitor that gained FDA approval in 2020, for a subset of patients requiring additional LDL-C lowering</p>
<p>When Koenig took the helm at Esperion in 2021, the Company&rsquo;s clinical team was conducting a cardiovascular outcomes trial with bempedoic acid that was conducted in the midst of a global pandemic (COVID-19). Three years later, they achieved another milestone, securing FDA approval as the only non-statin oral LDL-C lowering medication for reducing cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention patients. This vital indication addresses a significant unmet medical need, allowing Esperion to potentially help the millions of patients who cannot reach their goals on current therapies alone.</p>
<p>Esperion is focused on addressing all patients at risk for cardiovascular disease, including those often overlooked populations with few treatment alternatives. With its flagship product, bempedoic acid, now covering the full spectrum of cholesterol management and CV risk reduction, the company is well-positioned to make a seismic impact on global heart health.</p>
<p>And this is only the beginning. Esperion&rsquo;s employees remain focused on executing its commercial strategy while identifying other indications which its next generation ACLY inhibitors may be able to address.</p>
<p><em>Below are the interview highlights:</em></p>
<p><strong>Driven by Passion and Personal Experience</strong></p>
<p>Sheldon's career has been a lifelong pursuit fueled by a deep passion for bringing life-saving medicines to patients in need. With unwavering dedication, he has committed himself to the noble cause of bringing innovative therapies to market&mdash;therapies that possess the power to help patients and, quite literally, save lives.</p>

This personal connection has only strengthened his resolve to contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and the development of progressive treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Fighting Cardiovascular Disease </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While cancer has rightly received significant attention, Esperion understands that cardiovascular disease remains the number one killer globally. This sobering reality reinforcess the Company&rsquo;s conviction that education plays a crucial role in empowering patients to take preventative measures and seek timely treatment.</p>
<p>Recognizing the transformative impact that accessible information and regular therapies can have on patient outcomes, the Company emphasizes the importance of patients being aware that cardiovascular events can often be prevented through simple steps, such as obtaining a lipid panel and adhering to a prescribed treatment regimen.</p>
<p>This belief in the power of education and preventative care has become a driving force behind Esperion, where the goal is to deliver innovative medicines that help patients achieve and maintain their health goals, both in the present and for the long-term future.</p>
<p>By emphasizing the significance of education and early intervention, Esperion aims to empower individuals to take control of their cardiovascular health, make informed decisions, and seek medical guidance before potentially life-threatening events occur.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the Company&rsquo;s dedication to delivering innovative medicines underscores his belief in the power of scientific breakthroughs to advance treatment options and improve patient outcomes. Through the development of novel therapies, Esperion envisions a future where cardiovascular disease is not just managed but effectively prevented and, ultimately, conquered.</p>
<p><strong>The Lifesaving Impact of Cancidas</strong></p>
<p>In 1999/2000, Koenig played a pivotal role in the launch of Cancidas (Caspofungin Acetate) for Merck, a novel antifungal medication that would go on to save countless lives worldwide. This novel drug represented a significant breakthrough in the treatment of fungal infections, exhibiting no resistance and proving effective in treating both candidemia and aspergillosis in patients with compromised immune systems, including solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, and those living with HIV.</p>

As he witnessed first-hand, this drug truly lived up to its life-saving potential, becoming a blockbuster success that contributed to the successful treatment of countless immunocompromised patients globally.</p>
<p>The significance of Cancidas cannot be overstated. Before its introduction, the medical community faced limited options for combating severe fungal infections, particularly in patients with weakened immune systems. These individuals were especially vulnerable to the devastating effects of such infections, often leading to life-threatening complications.</p>
<p>Cancidas represented a paradigm shift in antifungal therapy, offering a powerful and effective solution that could be tailored to the unique needs of these high-risk patient populations.

This multifaceted approach allows him to stay informed about futuristic research, emerging therapies, regulatory developments, and the strategic initiatives of key players in the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Health Care Practitioner Outreach and Patient Activation</strong></p>
<p>Regarding how Esperion might assist patients in achieving their health objectives, Esperion has embarked on a plan that includes physician education and patient activation.</p>
<p>The recent growth of Esperion's field sales force, coupled with the use of innovative digital tools, enables ~45,000 physicians (PCPs and Specialists) to gain awareness of these life saving medicines. This investment in education helps clinicians help their patients in controlling cholesterol levels and reducing their cardiovascular risk.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that patient activation is equally crucial in this endeavor, Esperion has launched a consumer campaign designed to encourage individuals to ask more questions regarding their cardiovascular well-being, specifically their risk of experiencing a cardiovascular event. This proactive approach aims to raise awareness and foster open dialogues between patients and their healthcare providers, empowering individuals to take an active role in their health journey.</p>
<p>The vision for Esperion extends beyond merely providing treatment options; it involves equipping both physicians and patients with the necessary tools and resources to facilitate informed discussions about cardiovascular health and enable collaborative efforts in setting and achieving treatment goals.</p>
<p><strong>Multifaceted Approach</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to address the challenges of managing high cholesterol and cardiovascular health, the Company has implemented a two-pronged approach that combines the strengths of a robust field force with innovative digital strategies. This multifaceted strategy reflects the company's adaptability and responsiveness to the evolving landscape in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The first prong of this approach involves a substantial expansion of Esperion's field presence. The company now has 150 territory managers actively engaged in the field, as well as a team of scientific liaisons who are experts in the cardiovascular space. This robust field force plays a crucial role in establishing direct connections with healthcare professionals, facilitating face-to-face interactions, and providing personalized support and education.</p>
<p>However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also catalyzed a significant shift in the way pharmaceutical companies approach marketing and physician engagement. Recognizing this change, Esperion has embraced digital strategies as the second prong of its approach, leveraging various digital channels such as emails, websites, and other online platforms to deliver promotional messages to physicians effectively.</p>
<p>This two-pronged approach acknowledges the importance of maintaining a strong physical presence through the field force while simultaneously adapting to the growing demand for digital engagement in the post-COVID era. By combining these two complementary strategies, Esperion aims to maximize its reach and effectiveness in communicating with healthcare professionals and delivering valuable information about its products and services.</p>
<p>Implementing this multifaceted approach underscores the Company&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and its willingness to adapt to evolving market conditions. By embracing both traditional field-based tactics and cutting-edge digital strategies, Esperion is positioning itself to meet the diverse needs and preferences of healthcare professionals, ensuring that its messaging and support can be delivered through multiple channels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Esperion's focus on measuring the success of these initiatives demonstrates a data-driven approach and a commitment to continuous improvement. By closely monitoring the effectiveness of its field force and digital strategies, the Company can make informed decisions, refine its tactics, and allocate resources effectively to achieve optimal results in promoting cardiovascular health and managing high cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging Consumer Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the multifaceted strategies targeting healthcare professionals, Esperion's has undertaken a bold approach to engaging consumers directly by launching a robust consumer campaign targeting specific geographic regions, aiming to raise awareness and promote cardiovascular health among the general public.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Esperion has forged a strategic partnership with RFK Racing, sponsoring both the #6 NEXLIZET&reg; (bempedoic acid and ezetimibe) and #17 NEXLETOL&reg; (bempedoic acid) cars in the prestigious NASCAR&trade; Cup Series. This high-profile collaboration not only showcases the company's commitment to cardiovascular health but also provides a platform for reaching a vast audience of motorsports enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Esperion will sponsor four NASCAR Cup races during the 2024 season, leveraging these prominent events to deliver accompanying programming and educational content on the importance of cardiovascular well-being. This innovative approach demonstrates the company's commitment to leveraging unconventional channels to disseminate vital health information and engage with a diverse range of individuals.</p>
<p>By combining targeted consumer campaigns with the excitement and popularity of NASCAR, Esperion is implementing a bold strategy that aims to capture the attention of the broader public. This approach recognizes the importance of reaching beyond traditional healthcare settings and embracing innovative avenues to promote cardiovascular health and raise awareness about the risks associated with conditions like high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Esperion's partnership with RFK Racing not only provides a platform for brand visibility but also serves as a powerful tool for connecting with audiences who may not traditionally engage with healthcare messaging. By aligning its brand with the thrill and passion of NASCAR, the company has the potential to resonate with individuals who may not have previously been receptive to traditional health campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Expanding Access and Advocating for Patient Choice</strong></p>
<p>The Company&rsquo;s devotion to ensuring widespread access to it&rsquo;s innovative cardiovascular medications is evident in the company's proactive approach to collaborating with both commercial and government payers. With the recent approval of its expanded labels, Esperion is actively working to broaden access to its therapies, enabling more patients to benefit from these potentially life-changing treatments.</p>
<p>Koenig&rsquo;s personal involvement in this endeavour underscores his commitment to the cause. He is not only guiding the strategy for engaging with payers but also taking his advocacy efforts directly to the field, speaking with prescribing physicians and payer management teams. This hands-on approach demonstrates his understanding of the importance of building strong relationships and open lines of communication with key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem.</p>
<p>Esperion&rsquo;s mission is driven by a fundamental belief that every patient should have the opportunity to access it&rsquo;s medicines if their physician deems it appropriate for their individual needs. This patient-centric philosophy recognizes the uniqueness of each individual's medical journey and the crucial role that healthcare providers play in determining the most suitable course of treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Forging Partnerships for Improved Cardiovascular Care</strong></p>
<p>Esperion&rsquo;s commitment to advancing cardiovascular care extends beyond the Company&rsquo;s efforts, as evidenced by it&rsquo;s strategic partnerships with renowned organizations such as the Family Heart Foundation, the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the American Heart Association (AHA). These collaborations reflect the belief in the power of collective action and&nbsp; understanding that addressing complex health challenges requires a multifaceted approach.</p>
<p>One notable example of Esperion's collaborative efforts is the recent partnership with the ACC, Amgen, and other companies on a program aimed at empowering patients to be more actively involved in monitoring their LDL-C levels. This initiative underscores the Company&rsquo;s recognition that patient education and engagement are crucial components in the fight against cardiovascular disease.</p>

He is an active member of the China-Canada Entrepreneur Association and is deeply committed to fostering relationships and strengthening the ties between the Chinese and Canadian communities. Furthermore, SINOBEC Group Inc. invests annually in the community, supporting various social organizations in their efforts to improve the lives of those around them. During the COVID-19 pandemic, John and his companies donated tens of millions of masks and other personal protective equipment, with a total value exceeding $10 million, to various nonprofit organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Optimizing Supply Chain Efficiency in the Metals Industry</strong></p>
<p>The metals industry is a critical pillar of the global economy, providing essential raw materials and components for a wide range of industries, from manufacturing to construction to technology. However, the complexity of metal supply chains poses significant challenges for businesses in this sector. Effective supply chain management is crucial for ensuring the smooth flow of materials, optimizing production processes, and meeting the evolving demands of the market.</p>
<p>John's previous experience as a metal trader has equipped him with valuable insights that can contribute to Sinobec's goal of increasing efficiency in metal product supply and fabrication. His understanding of the industry's unique dynamics, from global sourcing and warehousing to timely delivery and customer relationships, will be instrumental in shaping Sinobec's value proposition.</p>
<p>Sinobec's focus on providing customers with high-quality, cost-effective, and timely precious metal solutions globally aligns well with John's expertise. By leveraging his knowledge of the metal trade, Sinobec can strengthen its global sourcing capabilities, optimize its warehousing and logistics network, and enhance its ability to deliver products promptly to customers across diverse markets.</p>

This will enable the company to better understand and respond to the evolving needs of its customers, further solidifying its position as a trusted provider of comprehensive metal solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies for Navigating Price Volatility and Minimizing Risk</strong></p>
<p>The metal industry has faced significant challenges in recent years, with commodity prices fluctuating widely and profit margins being squeezed as a result. Companies in this sector have had to adapt quickly to these changes in order to remain competitive and profitable.</p>
<p>One effective strategy that some metal companies have employed is exploring commodity hedge strategies with banks and consultants. By entering into derivative contracts at the time they pay their suppliers and take physical possession of the product, these companies are able to eliminate the effect of any price volatility up to the targeted time that the customer takes delivery of the product and a final invoice is issued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sinobec, for example, has implemented a hedging policy aimed at eliminating the effect of any volatility in the price of aluminum on its back-to-back sales. By taking this proactive approach, the company is able to minimize the impact of market price fluctuations on its bottom line.</p>
<p>In addition to hedging strategies, metal companies can also explore other ways to adapt to changes in the industry. This might include diversifying their product offerings, investing in new technologies to improve efficiency and productivity, or expanding into new markets.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the key to success in the metal industry is being able to adapt quickly to changing market conditions and implement strategies that mitigate risk and protect profit margins. By exploring options like commodity hedging and other innovative approaches, metal companies can position themselves for long-term success in an increasingly volatile and competitive landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Commitment to Quality and Customer Value</strong></p>

This vision drives the innovative team at<strong> Fathom Health</strong>, a San Francisco-based company that's revolutionizing medical documentation through the power of artificial intelligence. In an era where healthcare professionals often find themselves drowning in administrative tasks, Fathom Health emerges as a beacon of hope, promising to alleviate the burden of paperwork and allow doctors to reclaim their time for what matters most - patient care.</p>
<p>Founded on the principle that technology should enhance rather than hinder the healthcare experience, Fathom Health has developed a cutting-edge AI system that's transforming the landscape of medical coding and documentation. Traditionally, these tasks have been labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Physicians frequently spend hours meticulously documenting patient encounters, often extending their workdays and contributing to the growing problem of burnout in the medical field.</p>
<p>Fathom Health's solution leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to automate and streamline the complex process of medical coding. By doing so, the company not only reduces the administrative workload on healthcare providers but also improves the accuracy and consistency of medical documentation.</p>
<p>The implications of this technology are far-reaching. With more accurate coding, healthcare organizations can ensure proper reimbursement for services rendered, reducing revenue loss due to coding errors. Moreover, the time saved on documentation allows healthcare providers to see more patients, potentially improving access to care in underserved communities.</p>
<p>But perhaps the most significant impact of Fathom Health's technology is on the quality of patient care. By freeing up physicians' time and mental energy, the AI system enables them to be more present and engaged during patient interactions. This could lead to improved diagnosis, more comprehensive treatment plans, and ultimately, better health outcomes.</p>
<p>As healthcare continues to evolve in the digital age, companies like Fathom Health are at the forefront, driving innovation that benefits both providers and patients. By harnessing the power of AI to tackle one of healthcare's most persistent challenges, Fathom Health is not just changing the way medical documentation is managed - it's reshaping the future of healthcare itself.</p>
<p>In a world where technology often seems to complicate rather than simplify our lives, Fathom Health stands out as a prime example of how AI can be harnessed to solve real-world problems and make a tangible difference in people's lives. As the company continues to grow and refine its technology, it's clear that the future of healthcare documentation is here - and it's powered by artificial intelligence.</p>
<h2><strong>Advanced AI Integration for Enhanced Medical Coding</strong></h2>

This platform excels in analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) and interpreting clinical notes with remarkable precision, transforming them into accurate medical codes. The traditionally labor-intensive process of medical coding, which could take hours manually, is now accomplished swiftly and with higher accuracy through Fathom Health&rsquo;s innovative approach.</p>
<h3><strong>Alleviating Administrative Burdens</strong></h3>
<p>One of the primary advantages of Fathom Health's AI platform is its ability to significantly reduce the time and effort required for documentation. Physicians are now able to dedicate more time to direct patient care rather than being bogged down by paperwork, thereby enhancing patient satisfaction and overall care quality. This shift from administrative tasks to patient-focused activities underscores a crucial improvement in the healthcare delivery model.</p>
<h3><strong>Elevating Accuracy and Ensuring Compliance</strong></h3>
<p>Medical coding extends beyond mere documentation; it is essential for billing and maintaining compliance. Errors in coding can lead to claim denials, potential legal complications, and financial losses. Fathom Health's AI-driven solution minimizes these risks by ensuring a high level of accuracy, thus safeguarding against such issues and maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
<h3><strong>Realizing Cost Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Automating the documentation process through Fathom Health's platform allows healthcare facilities to cut down on the need for extensive administrative staff, resulting in significant cost savings. Additionally, accurate medical coding maximizes reimbursement and reduces the likelihood of claim denials, further bolstering financial efficiency within healthcare organizations.</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying a Crucial Gap</strong></h2>
<p>Mr. Ardiri, together with seasoned industry professionals, recognized a significant gap as they navigated the intricate landscape of IoT. Despite the rapid growth of IoT devices, there was a glaring deficiency in robust, integrated security measures. This issue was compounded by an industry trend that prioritized rapid product launches over comprehensive security architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>Founding Philosophy of RIoT Secure</strong></h2>

<p>"By implementing isolation, we ensure that security is not an afterthought but an integral part of the device&rsquo;s essence," states Ardiri. "It&rsquo;s about more than just protection; it&rsquo;s about empowering developers to focus on other critical aspects of IoT devices, confident in the knowledge that their products are inherently secure."</p>

<h4>Patsky's journey to this philosophy wasn't paved with unbroken success. He candidly shares the invaluable lessons he gleaned from a failed venture&mdash;a small food business launched with his husband. The experience, though financially unrewarding, became a classroom that taught him more than any academic institution could. The core lesson is that having a brilliant idea isn't enough; success hinges on securing financing and assembling a talented team.</h4>
<h4>Reflecting on the pitfalls of their food business, Patsky draws parallels to broader business landscapes. He highlights the significance of not just having a good idea but also possessing the financial backing and the right people to execute it. Drawing a historical reference, he points out the seemingly 'dumb' idea of selling books with hefty discounts and free shipping&mdash;a strategy that evolved into Amazon's triumphant business model, AWS, now a major contributor to the company's earnings.</h4>
<h4>Patsky's narrative urges us to look beyond conventional success markers and recognize the transformative power of resilience and adaptability. In a world where financial victories often overshadow the intangible impact on humanity, Matthew Patsky's journey stands as a testament to the idea that true success is measured not just in profits but in the positive change we bring to the world.</h4>

<h3><strong>Journey as a Business Leader</strong></h3>
<h4>Matt embarked on his journey as a business leader as a young administrative assistant at Lehman Brothers, stationed on the 101st floor of the 2 World Trade Center. Within a remarkably short span of three years, his dedication and competence led to a significant promotion to Assistant VP of Equity Research. This period was instrumental in shaping Matt's perspective on professional development and seizing opportunities within an organization. His realization that Lehman actively encouraged such growth prompted him to register for the CFA program and pursue every licensing exam available, showcasing a relentless pursuit of excellence.</h4>
<h4>Navigating the corporate landscape with determination, by the age of 22, Matt had acquired the necessary registrations not only to manage his department but also the entire firm. What sets this narrative apart is Matt's strategic approach&mdash;focusing on the job he desired while excelling in his current role. This strategy, coupled with leveraging educational benefits and making indispensable contributions, allowed him to defy conventional career trajectories.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3><strong>The Growth and Contribution of Trillium</strong></h3>
<h4>Trillium, a pioneer in integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors into investment processes, witnessed transformative leadership under Matt's guidance. Assuming the role in 2009, Matt strategically expanded Trillium's legacy into the institutional market, resulting in almost tenfold growth. Since its inception in 1982, Trillium has consistently demonstrated the materiality of ESG factors in investment decisions. Matt's leadership not only amplified this legacy but also contributed to the broader adoption of ESG integration across the investment industry, aligning with fiduciary duties.</h4>
<h4>Motivating Trillium's workforce is centered on a profound mission&mdash;leveraging clients' capital for positive social and environmental impacts. Beyond financial success, Matt emphasizes the importance of contributing to a more equitable, green, and sustainable planet. Trillium's trajectory under Matt's stewardship exemplifies a business model where financial success coexists with a commitment to societal and environmental betterment.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3><strong>The Future of Trillium</strong></h3>
<h4>In its current phase of "going global," Trillium is experiencing unprecedented growth, having successfully launched strategies in Australia. The firm anticipates further expansion into Europe by the end of 2022. This strategic global expansion aligns with the increasing demand for Trillium's services, positioning the organization as a significant player on the international stage. Matt's vision for Trillium includes a steadfast commitment to making a positive impact on a global scale, reflecting the organization's ongoing success and influence.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3><strong>The Journey &amp; Responsibilities of A CEO</strong></h3>
<h4>Matt's journey as a business leader is deeply rooted in his early years in Enfield, Connecticut, where he was born into a blue-collar Catholic family. His parents' dedication and the experience of being a latchkey kid shaped his work ethic. Matt's early foray into investing at age 11, investing $500 in socially responsible funds, showcased his innate curiosity and commitment to aligning investments with broader societal impact.</h4>
<h4>Faced with challenges in securing a job in economic development post-graduation, Matt turned to his second passion&mdash;investing. His entry into the industry at Lehman marked the beginning of a career dedicated to understanding the connection between quality management and company performance. Matt's commitment to socially responsible investing, particularly incorporating ESG factors, defied norms on 1980s Wall Street.</h4>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h3><strong>Balance in Personal and Professional Life &amp; Personal Goals</strong></h3>
<h4>For Matt, achieving a balance between personal and professional life is essential for sustained success. Taking breaks for travel and frequent weekends at Cape Cod with his husband are integral to maintaining a positive environment. Matt's personal goal is to propel Trillium to a global scale, establishing it as the premier organization for impact investing worldwide. This visionary objective is underlined by Matt's dedication to making Trillium synonymous with positive societal and environmental contributions on a global scale. His advice to aspiring business leaders revolves around focusing on passion, disregarding naysayers, and fostering self-belief&mdash;a mantra derived from his own journey of overcoming doubts and skepticism.</h4>1f1:["$","section",null,{"className":"bg-white py-6","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container ","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"border-b-[4px] border-black  overflow-hidden relative w-full h-[60px] leading-[50px]","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"inline-block lg:text-[22px]  uppercase py-[5px] px-5 bg-[#001045] text-white","children":"Featured Companies"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"bg-[#001045] w-[85px] h-[32px] rotate-[75deg] inline-block -ml-[40px]"}]]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"md:flex justify-center gap-14  mt-10 [mask-image:linear-gradient(to_bottom,transparent,black_25%,black_75%,transparent)] max-h-[739px] overflow-hidden hidden","children":[["$","$L215",null,{"className":"hidden md:block","duration":15,"directionY":"up","children":[["$","$Lc","0",{"href":"/feature/finding-love-the-elite-matchmaking-experience-with-selective-search","className":"card","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"src":"https://executiveheadlines.com/admin/media/1731658850.png","alt":"Finding Love: The Elite Matchmaking Experience with Selective Search","width":100,"height":100,"className":"w-[120px] h-[70px]"}]}],["$","$Lc","1",{"href":"/feature/missionwired-empowering-nonprofits-through-digital-mastery","className":"card","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"src":"https://executiveheadlines.com/admin/media/1731440160.png","alt":"MissionWired: Empowering Nonprofits Through Digital Mastery","width":100,"height":100,"className":"w-[120px] h-[70px]"}]}],["$","$Lc","2",{"href":"/feature/powering-the-future-qiq-technologies-takes-on-energy-challenges","className":"card","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"src":"https://executiveheadlines.com/admin/media/1731440097.png","alt":"Powering the Future: QiO Technologies Takes on Energy Challenges","width":100,"height":100,"className":"w-[120px] h-[70px]"}]}],["$","$Lc","3",{"href":"/feature/resource-logistics-group-transforming-transportation-management","className":"card","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"src":"https://executiveheadlines.com/admin/media/1731440043.png","alt":"Resource Logistics Group, Inc.: Transforming Transportation Management","width":100,"height":100,"className":"w-[120px] h-[70px]"}]}],["$","$Lc","4",{"href":"/feature/jmb-project-management-elevating-standards-in-project-management","className":"card","children":["$","$Lb",null,{"src":"https://executiveheadlines.com/admin/media/1731439974.png","alt":"JMB Project Management Co.
